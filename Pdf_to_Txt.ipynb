SOULE, University of Arizona\\r\\n\\r\\nAbstract\\r\\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children fell victim\\r\\nto a dramatic retrenchment as states submitted waivers, or permission slips to experiment\\r\\n\\r\\nwith their public assistance programs by implementing new methods of exclusion and\\r\\nregulation. We find that Republican states were quick to submitfederal waivers to the\\r\\nthe AFDC program, as were states with high AFDC payments. As Soule and Zylan\\r\\n(1997) found in their study of an earlier wave of welfare retrenchment in the U.S.,\\r\\nstates with higher minority group populations and heavier AFDC caseloads were quick\\r\\nto pass waivers. Following Pierson (1994, 1996), we find that states with an increasing\\r\\ntax revenue base and with a high proportion of Social Security recipients were quick to\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmit waivers, while states with a high proportion of Unemployment Insurance\\r\\nrecipients were slow to do so. We also find evidencefor the geographic diffusion of waiver\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmission and that states experiencingfiscal crisis were more susceptible to the diffusing\\r\\n\\r\\nof waivers. Finally, wefind that states which are traditionally innovative with regard\\r\\nto policy decisions served as referents to other states puzzling over whether or not to\\r\\nsubmit waivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents of welfare reform in the U.S. were little surprised when Bill Clinton\\r\\npledged in 1992 to \"end welfare as we know it\"and fewer were surprised that what\\r\\nhe meant by that was ending entitlement to public assistance under Aid to Families\\r\\nwith Dependent Children (AFDC). The AFDC program has been the focus of the\\r\\ndiscourse of welfare reform for more than forty years, and this discourse was\\r\\n* The authors would like to thank Elisabeth Clemens, Paula England, Don Grant, Henrich Greve,\\r\\nLinda Molm, and Marc Schneiberg for comments on an earlier version of this paper, Irenee\\r\\nBeattie, Karen Christopher, and Jennifer Murdock for research support, and David Strang for\\r\\n\\r\\nuse of his SAS-IML Routines for the analysis.

In\\r\\nthe late 1980s and 1990s, an even more dramatic rollback of public assistance\\r\\noccurred, with the implementation of new mechanisms of exclusion and regulation\\r\\n\\r\\nand the introduction of time limits: the first step toward ending the entitlement\\r\\nstatus of one of the central titles of the American welfare state.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the discursive similarities between these two phases of welfare reform,\\r\\nthere were substantive parallels as well. During both phases, policy changes were\\r\\n\\r\\ninitially most dramatic at the state level. New program initiatives were undertaken\\r\\nby the states in an effort to enforce work among recipients, to exclude certain types\\r\\n\\r\\nof applicants for assistance, and to establish new mechanisms of surveillance.1\\r\\nDuring both phases, these state-level policy innovations were eventually\\r\\nincorporated into national legislation. Given the apparent similarities in content\\r\\n\\r\\nof these two phases of welfare reform, one might expect similar factors to have\\r\\nproduced them. In predicting adoption rates for the earlier wave of reform, Soule\\r\\n\\r\\nand Zylan (1997) found that a number of processes were at work. First, states with\\r\\nheavy caseloads, racially restricted political access, stingy old age assistance\\r\\nprograms, and an absence of maternalist state advocates had higher rates of adoption\\r\\n\\r\\nof punitive work requirements. In short, those states characterized by the poor\\r\\nincorporation of African Americans into the polity, high recipient rates, and a lack\\r\\nof benefit generosity in their programs of social provision were in the forefront of\\r\\nadoption. Partisanship played a role as well; the authors note with some surprise\\r\\nthe significance of Democratic leadership in the adoption of work requirements.\\r\\nDemocrats may have been adopting a partisan stance of policy innovativeness; net\\r\\n\\r\\nof all other characteristics, states with a history of policy innovation were faster to\\r\\n\\r\\nadopt work requirements than less innovative states. The authors also found\\r\\nevidence of institutional and cultural diffusion.\\r\\nA quick glance at the pattern of submission of federal waivers in the AFDC\\r\\nprogram during the most recent wave of reform suggests that different kinds of\\r\\n\\r\\nstates may have been leading the way. Since the late 1980s, states have applied for\\r\\nwaivers, which are federal permission slips to experiment with the administration\\r\\nof public assistance programs. Such reform efforts require waivers from the federal\\r\\ngovernment because they diverge from the broadly inclusive language of\\r\\n\\r\\nentitlement spelled out in the Social Security Act. Table 1 shows that while some\\r\\nof the earliest states to apply for waivers were historically meager welfare states\\r\\n(Alabama, Georgia) many others were historically progressive and generous welfare\\r\\n\\r\\nstates. Ohio, New Jersey, and Minnesota each were early adopters of new assistance\\r\\ncommitments and have set relatively high benefit levels, and New York, California,\\r\\nand Wisconsin have been national leaders in AFDC and other welfare state\\r\\nprograms. All were among the states submitting waivers in the early 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 625\\r\\n\\r\\nTABLE 1.

Has a new logic\\r\\nof welfare reform emerged at the state-level in the past decade - one being led by\\r\\n\\r\\ndifferent states than the previous wave of reform?\\r\\nIn this article, we use historical and quantitative evidence to model the\\r\\nsubmission of federal waivers in the AFDC program between the years 1989 and\\r\\n\\r\\n1995, the year prior to the enactment of federal legislation that essentially abolished\\r\\n\\r\\nthe AFDC program. We examine the small, newly emergent literature on policy\\r\\nretrenchment (Bowles & Gintis 1982; Myles & Pierson 1997; Pierson 1994, 1996;\\r\\nSoule & Zylan 1997) to develop and test hypotheses about the economic, political,\\r\\nand institutional dimensions of contemporary welfare reform in the states. To\\r\\n\\r\\nforeshadow our results, we find that the submission of federal AFDC waivers was,\\r\\n\\r\\nindeed, led by different states than those that led the earlier wave, and in this case\\r\\nRepublican legislators, not Democrats, led the way. However, while the actors leading\\r\\nstate-level retrenchment may have been different, there are striking similarities\\r\\nbetween the mechanisms driving retrenchment in both cases. We find that\\r\\n\\r\\npartisanship, racial politics and the institutional dimensions of the policy\\r\\nenvironment continue to be crucial factors predicting which states will enact\\r\\nrestrictive reforms in their public assistance programs. Additionally, as was the case\\r\\nin the earlier wave, we find evidence that these reforms diffused from state to state\\r\\n\\r\\nin a systematic fashion.

While\\r\\n\\r\\nsome of this research makes mention of welfare \"backlash\" (Borg & Castles 1981;\\r\\nCastles 1982; Wilensky 1975) very few studies have attempted to systematically\\r\\nmodel the determinants of policies of retrenchment. This reflects the impact of\\r\\n\\r\\nthe work of T.H. Marshall (1963), who predicted a steady, progressive accretion of\\r\\ncivil, political, and social rights, through the enactment of policies requiring ever\\r\\ndeeper levels of state intervention. However, as states and nations enter the\\r\\npostindustrial phase of capitalism, and as the geopolitical ground of citizenship\\r\\nclaims appears to be undergoing reexamination (Soysal 1994), welfare\\r\\nretrenchment has become an increasingly salient feature of policy development\\r\\nin the U.S. and Europe. The determinants of welfare retrenchment are, therefore,\\r\\n\\r\\nsimultaneously important to uncover and (as yet) little theorized.\\r\\nThe work of Paul Pierson and colleagues is an exception. Pierson\\'s examination\\r\\n\\r\\nof retrenchment efforts in the United States, Great Britain, Germany and Sweden\\r\\nsuggests that these policy developments are not adequately explained by existing\\r\\n\\r\\ntheories of the welfare state3 (Myles & Pierson 1997; Pierson 1994; Pierson 1996).\\r\\nNor are they captured by a model that inverts or \"mirrors\" standard accounts of\\r\\nexpansion. Instead, Pierson argues that retrenchment efforts must be thought of\\r\\nas a qualitatively new social and political process, the product of a \"new politics of\\r\\nthe welfare state\" (Pierson 1996). In nation-states characterized by extensive welfare\\r\\nstate commitments, he notes, the importance of entrenched interests and programbased political constituencies must be incorporated into any explanation of policy\\r\\nretrenchment. His account therefore stresses the importance of \"critical constraints\\r\\non reform resulting from the role of supportive interest groups and, ultimately,\\r\\n\\r\\nvoters\" (Pierson 1996:144). In other words, the retrenchment of welfare state\\r\\nprograms is difficult and perilous for would-be reformers. The conditions of success\\r\\nhave more to do with the ability of reformers to sidestep public outrage over proposed\\r\\n\\r\\ncuts (itself a function of the policy environment within which reformers operate)\\r\\nthan with the strength or weakness of the left, the autonomy of state actors, or the\\r\\n\\r\\nnature of economic development. While attacks on the poor seem to have been at\\r\\nthe center of retrenchment efforts pursued by conservative governments, Pierson\\r\\nnotes that whether or not a program is means-tested (or otherwise targets the poor)\\r\\n\\r\\nis not the best predictor of its vulnerability to retrenchment. Instead, he claims\\r\\nthat \"retrenchment occurred where supporting interest groups were weak, or where\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 627\\r\\n\\r\\nthe government found ways to prevent the mobilization of these groups\\' supporters\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(Pierson 1994:6).4\\r\\nPierson\\'s claim that there is a new politics of the welfare state is persuasive in\\r\\nlight of his in-depth, comparative analyses of retrenchment in several major policy\\r\\n\\r\\nareas. His empirical research, however, is largely qualitative, and focuses on crossnational comparisons. This approach, while useful in generating rich, detailed\\r\\nnarratives of the processes of retrenchment, may mask broader mechanisms -\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch as institutional processes of diffusion - better captured by quantitative\\r\\nmethods. We seek to understand developments in one program - Aid to Families\\r\\nwith Dependent Children - over time and at the state level, and are thus afforded\\r\\nthe opportunity to use quantitative data to model welfare state retrenchment. In\\r\\n\\r\\nanother sense, we are asking a slightly different question than Pierson and\\r\\ncolleagues (although it is one informed by the model they propose): has state-level\\r\\nretrenchment in the AFDC program occurred as the result of a substantially new\\r\\n\\r\\nform of electoral politics played out on policy-specific playing fields, as Pierson\\'s\\r\\nwork suggests it has? Or has it followed the same logic of institutionally-driven\\r\\nchange as the earlier wave of state-level AFDC reform (Soule & Zylan 1997)?\\r\\nAs part of our investigation of the institutional dimensions of retrenchment,\\r\\nwe directly examine the question of policy diffusion. According to Soule and Zylan\\r\\n(1997) work requirements diffused systematically across states in the middle part\\r\\nof this century. In that particular case, the authors found evidence of cultural\\r\\ndiffusion, but other sorts of linkages may exist between states as well. In recent\\r\\nyears, there has been a dramatic resurgence in interest in the diffusion of various\\r\\nsocial processes (including policy outcomes), spurred, perhaps, by new ways to\\r\\nmodel diffusion (see Strang & Soule 1998). Central to this growing literature is\\r\\nthe idea that information about previous actors\\' actions is utilized by actors\\r\\nattempting to make decisions about how to approach some problem. Under\\r\\nconditions of uncertainty, the careful assessment (and perhaps mimicry) of others\\'\\r\\nactions is a rational strategy for actors to take (Soule 1995).5 Additionally, it seems\\r\\nplausible that certain actors would be more likely to be monitored by actors\\r\\n\\r\\nattempting to make decisions and that other actors would be more likely to \"jump\\r\\non the bandwagon\" once a solution begins to diffuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs diffusion processes were evident in the first round of welfare reform, we\\r\\nexpect they may have operated in this round as well. Below, we generate and test\\r\\nspecific hypotheses derived from the existing literature on welfare state\\r\\nretrenchment and policy diffusion. First, however, we discuss the federal\\r\\n\\r\\nenvironment within which states pursued newly restrictive AFDC programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c628 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Changing Federal Policy Environment and the Submission of Waivers\\r\\nin AFDC\\r\\nAlthough the right of state programs to request federal waivers in order to\\r\\nexperiment with public assistant program characteristics is as old as the A(F)DC\\r\\nprogram itself, it is not surprising that there was a sudden and rapid increase in\\r\\nthe number of waivers submitted during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Beginning\\r\\n\\r\\nwith Ronald Reagan\\'s presidency, the federal government actively encouraged states\\r\\nto depart from business as usual where welfare administration was concerned. In\\r\\nfact, as has been documented elsewhere, the (partly successful) efforts of the Reagan\\r\\nand Bush administrations to cut federal expenditures on public assistance may\\r\\nhave produced more than benign \"encouragement.\" The election of a Democrat\\r\\nin 1992 did not significantly alter this environment, although the public\\r\\n\\r\\ndeclarations by Clinton the candidate and Clinton the President may have\\r\\nsignificantly publicized the receptiveness of the administration to waiver requests\\r\\n\\r\\nby the states. What this added up to was a strong incentive for states to at least\\r\\nconsider the possibility of reforming their AFDC programs.\\r\\nThe first stage of this process began when Ronald Reagan, almost immediately\\r\\n\\r\\nupon assuming the presidency, launched a critique of the American economy that\\r\\nplaced blame on the fact that the government budget was growing faster than the\\r\\nGNP - which he attributed to deficits, over-taxation, loose monetary policy,\\r\\n\\r\\nbureaucratic waste, and misguided welfare handouts (Tobin 1988). Thus, a key\\r\\nfeature of Reaganomics was a plan to curtail non-defense government spending,\\r\\nincluding and especially social welfare programs. He learned (at some political\\r\\ncost) that this was not to be achieved through an assault on social insurance\\r\\n\\r\\nprograms and he soon turned his attention to more politically vulnerable programs,\\r\\nsuch as AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nA central theme of Reagan-era federalism was the devolution of policy\\r\\nimplementation (and much of the funding responsibility) to the state level. Reagan\\r\\nAdministration efforts in the area of AFDC policy were merely one example of\\r\\nthis overall approach to governance. Critics of this approach and its encapsulation\\r\\nin the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 noted that it did little to provide\\r\\nstates freedom to be creative with new public assistance measures; rather it reduced\\r\\nthe share of administrative costs borne by the federal government. Still, it was clear\\r\\nthat a Reagan Era Department of Health and Human Services was likely to be rather\\r\\nmore laissez faire in its supervision of state activities than some of its predecessors,\\r\\nopening up the possibility of state experimentation in Title IV programs.\\r\\nIn the wake of OBRA, a few states began to institute work requirements\\r\\n\\r\\neligibility rules that require recipients to accept available employment or be denied\\r\\nassistance. But state-level reform efforts really exploded in the wake of the federal\\r\\nFamily Support Act of 1988. That Act instituted the Job Opportunities and Basic\\r\\nSkills program, which enabled states to require AFDC recipients to accept\\r\\nemployment or face benefit reductions or other sanctions. Many recipients were\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 629\\r\\n\\r\\ninitially exempted from JOBS and the program did nothing to create the actual\\r\\n\\r\\njobs recipients were intended to fill. But it set in place a structure that states began\\r\\nto build upon in their subsequent efforts to push poor women into private sector\\r\\nemployment and out of the public assistance system.\\r\\nThe election of another Republican president, George Bush, ensured the\\r\\ncontinued receptivity of federal agencies to state requests to experiment with AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the end of his term, Bush (in an increasingly pitched battle with \"New\\r\\nDemocrat\" challenger Bill Clinton) addressed welfare reform explicitly in his 1992\\r\\nState of the Union Address. Bush promised that his administration would make\\r\\nthe waiver process \"quicker and easier for every state that asks our help\" and he\\r\\nmade good on the offer: by July, his administration had approved six demonstration\\r\\nprojects. The arrival of a Democrat at the White House following the 1992 elections\\r\\nchanged little. Clinton made \"ending welfare as we know it\" a cornerstone of the\\r\\ncentrist Democratic agenda, and the swift approval - and even solicitation - of\\r\\nwaiver requests was adopted as a standing practice by his Department of Health\\r\\nand Human Services. Despite dissension within the Democratic Administration\\r\\nover the nature of welfare reform efforts (symbolized most dramatically by the\\r\\nresignation of HHS secretary Mary Jo Bane), the waiver approval process continued\\r\\n\\r\\nat a rapid pace throughout the first term of the Clinton presidency (Bane 1997).6\\r\\nDocuments issued from the Department of Health and Human Services during\\r\\n\\r\\nthis time make it clear that Clinton had encouraged approval of waiver requests\\r\\nand that the Department was working closely with state governors to expedite the\\r\\nprocess of state and local reform (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human\\r\\n\\r\\nServices 1994). Since the approval of waivers was undertaken procedurally and\\r\\nnot legislatively (an interagency council reviewed, approved, and oversaw requests\\r\\nfrom the states), a receptive administration virtually ensured a steady stream of\\r\\n\\r\\napprovals once requests were submitted by interested states.\\r\\nEven as waivers were understood to be state \"experiments,\" they were clearly\\r\\ninformed by federal policy. For example, the most popular reforms that were\\r\\nundertaken as part of state waiver projects after the Family Support Act was passed\\r\\n\\r\\nwere work requirements modeled on the JOBS program.7 The names of some of\\r\\nthese projects are instructive about the discourse of poverty that has come to\\r\\ndominate this phase of AFDC reform: Avenues to Self-Sufficiency Through\\r\\nEmployment and Training Services (ASSETS) in Alabama, Employing and Moving\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople Off Welfare and Encouraging Responsibility (EMPOWER) of Arizona, Work\\r\\nFirst (N. Carolina), and Learning, Earning and Parenting (LEAP) in Ohio (which\\r\\n\\r\\nwas also nicknamed \"Self-Sufficiency Through Tough Love\" by Ohio\\'s Governor\\r\\nGeorge Voinovich). A typical waiver package expanded JOBS participation\\r\\nrequirements and activities, increased sanctions for nonparticipation, and altered\\r\\n\\r\\nthe earned income disregard.8 States also implemented family caps, job training\\r\\nprograms, time limits, improved fraud detection systems, school attendance\\r\\nrequirements, categorical exclusions of some recipients (immigrants, teenage\\r\\n\\r\\nmothers, or mothers bearing children while receiving assistance), and changes in\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c630 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\ntheir transitional child care allowances. In short, waiver projects have sought to\\r\\nlimit eligibility, punish some forms of sexual/reproductive behavior, lower overall\\r\\nbenefits, encourage employment-focused ethics and behavior, and institute farreaching, permanent limits on the growth of the AFDC recipient population\\r\\n(particularly through time limits).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of these reforms were incorporated into the federal legislation that\\r\\nPresident Bill Clinton signed in the late summer of 1996. The Personal\\r\\nResponsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) established\\r\\n\\r\\ntime limits, new work requirements, incentives for state reductions in teen and\\r\\nunwed pregnancy rates, mechanisms for paternity enforcement, rules excluding\\r\\nlegal immigrants from eligibility, and changes in the child care allowances for aid\\r\\nrecipients. The PRWORA also marked a dramatic break with the past by ending\\r\\nthe entitlement status of AFDC.\\r\\nThus what began as an effort to cut federal expenditures on matching funds to\\r\\nstate public assistance programs evolved first into a federal policy encouraging state\\r\\n\\r\\nvariation in administration of those programs. It then evolved into a substantially\\r\\nnew federal policy on income maintenance for poor children and their caretakers.\\r\\nPolicy innovation was informed by, and then informed, federal policy and practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it is clear that Reagan-era policies and their progeny sparked a flurry of\\r\\nwelfare reform activity in the states, the actions of the federal government tell us\\r\\nlittle about which states submitted AFDC waivers and when. The Reagan, Bush,\\r\\nand Clinton Administrations\\' policies encouraged and provoked state autonomy\\r\\nin a universal fashion, yet not every state sought an AFDC waiver, and among those\\r\\n\\r\\nthat did, some acted more quickly than others. Did states act in response to\\r\\ncharacteristics of their AFDC programs that might have been directly or indirectly\\r\\naffected by Reagan-era policies (e.g., high caseloads)? Did \"fend-for-yourself\\r\\n\\r\\nfederalism\" create fiscal crises that drove state actors to look for ways to cut\\r\\nspending - leading them in the direction of the already vulnerable AFDC program?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf so, we would expect states with such crises to have been in the forefront of the\\r\\nreform wave. Alternatively, states may have responded to the uniformly stringent\\r\\n\\r\\n(and enticing) federal environment in varying ways, according to intrastate\\r\\ncharacteristics and/or dynamics linking states to each other. To explain which states\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmitted waivers and when, we examine quantitative data, utilizing diffusion\\r\\nmodels within an event history framework. Below, we outline the model and the\\r\\nhypotheses, then present and discuss our results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model\\r\\nSince we are interested in both inter- and intrastate factors which influenced the\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmission and diffusion of waivers, we use a relatively new diffusion model\\r\\nproposed by Strang and Tuma (1993). The model is conceptualized in an event\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 631\\r\\n\\r\\nhistory framework, making the interpretation of results intuitive for most social\\r\\nscientists.9 The model is particularly useful for our study because we are able to\\r\\ntest for spatial heterogeneity, or the idea that a state\\'s submission of a waiver may\\r\\naffect other states\\' rates of submission more or less depending on their location in\\r\\nthe same region, and depending on how influential the first state is. Additionally,\\r\\nwe are able to examine whether or not certain states are more or less vulnerable to\\r\\nthe diffusion of this type of policy retrenchment. The heterogenous diffusion model\\r\\nproposed by Strang and Tuma (1993) includes four vectors of effects and\\r\\nhypothesizes that the rate of adoption of an innovation (here, a submission of a\\r\\nwaiver) is a multiplicative function of these vectors. The first vector, the propensity\\r\\nvector, includes measures of a states \"intrinsic\" rate of waiver submission, as in a\\r\\ntraditional event history regression model. The second vector, the susceptibility vector,\\r\\n\\r\\nincludes measures of how vulnerable a state is to the actions of other states. The\\r\\nthird vector, the infectiousness vector, includes measures of how influential a state\\r\\nthat has already submitted a waiver is. The fourth vector is the diffusion vector, often\\r\\n\\r\\nreferred to as the proximity vector in the literature. The heterogenous diffusion\\r\\n\\r\\nmodel, described in Strang and Tuma (1993:621), is represented as:\\r\\n\\r\\nrn (t) = exp( aXn + E fVn + EX r\\'Ws + E 8 Zns)\\r\\ns565(t) se5\\'(t) se5\\'(t)\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere n is the state that has not yet submitted a waiver, and s is the state that has\\r\\nalready submitted a waiver. 10 In the model, Xn is the propensity vector, Vn is the\\r\\nsusceptibility vector, Ws is the infectiousness vector, and Zns is the diffusion vector.\\r\\nThe vectors of parameter estimates for each of these are denoted by: a,b,g, and d.\\r\\nThe models presented in this paper were estimated through a set of SAS macros\\r\\nwritten by David Strang (Strang 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurement and Hypotheses\\r\\nThe dependent variable in our analysis is the rate of state waiver submission1\" to\\r\\nthe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The year in which a state\\r\\nsubmitted a waiver was obtained from a chart of waiver activity compiled by the\\r\\nHudson Institute, a policy research center. The Hudson Institute obtained\\r\\n\\r\\ninformation on waiver activity directly from the DHHS. 12 Since reform activities\\r\\nhave been ongoing, data on state-level welfare practices have been in some flux.\\r\\nTherefore, we decided to cross-check the Hudson Institute data against five\\r\\nadditional sources. First, we consulted a 1996 report by the DHHS entitled,\\r\\n\"Selected Provisions of Approved State Welfare Reform Demonstration.\" Second,\\r\\nwe consulted the \"News in the States\" page of a website maintained by the American\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Welfare Association (APWA).13 Third, when available, we checked with\\r\\npublished press releases from the DHHS which outline the provisions of waivers\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c632 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nas they were approved by the federal government. 14 Fourth, we checked websites\\r\\nmaintained by individual states - especially those states that have websites from\\r\\ntheir public assistance agencies. Finally, we called public information personnel\\r\\nfrom each of the states\\' public assistance agencies, asking them to supply us with\\r\\n\\r\\nas much information as they could about the substance of waiver requests and the\\r\\ntiming of submission.\\r\\nThe first waiver was requested in 1989 following the enactment of the Family\\r\\n\\r\\nSupport Act; this is the start of our time period. The last was submitted in 1995. In\\r\\n1996 the Clinton Administration\\'s federal legislation was passed, effectively ending\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Aid to Families with Dependent Children program and fundamentally altering\\r\\nthe federal policy environment. Thus we do not collect data on any waivers\\r\\nsubmitted in 1996, as we expect states submitting waivers in that year to have been\\r\\n\\r\\nattempting to conform to the impending federal policy. As Table 1 indicates,\\r\\nbetween 1989 and 1995, 40 states submitted waivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the independent variables used in our analysis come from a variety of\\r\\nwidely available U.S. Government Sources (See Appendix A). Since many of these\\r\\n\\r\\ndata were not available yearly, we use linear interpolation to estimate betweenyear values for our measures. These independent variables are divided into four\\r\\ndifferent categories corresponding to the four different vectors of the model\\r\\n\\r\\ndiscussed above: Propensity, Susceptibility, Infectiousness, and Diffusion.15\\r\\nTHE PROPENSITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nThe propensity vector indicates the intrinsic characteristics of states that are\\r\\n\\r\\nexpected to affect the rate of submission of waivers. The measures in this vector\\r\\nare best thought of as one would think of covariates in a traditional event history\\r\\nmodel. We break the analysis down according to the logic of causality. Broad\\r\\n\\r\\nsocioeconomic factors should be causally prior to medium-term political\\r\\nconfigurations, which should be causally prior to short-term institutional\\r\\ncharacteristics in shaping states\\' actions toward waiver submission.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the work of Soule and Zylan (1997), we first examine the effect of\\r\\neconomic development on submission. According to the \"logic of industrialism\"\\r\\nthesis of welfare state development, welfare states expand along with industrial\\r\\ndevelopment (Cutright 1965; Wilensky 1975). If it was the logic of welfare states\\r\\nto expand with industrialism, perhaps it is the logic of advanced welfare states to\\r\\npare back as industrial economies evolve into service-based economies. To examine\\r\\n\\r\\nthis hypothesis, in our models we include a measure of service sector receipts as a\\r\\npercentage of the gross state product. If there is a \"logic of postindustrialism\" driving\\r\\n\\r\\nretrenchment, we would expect this measure to increase the rate of waiver activity.\\r\\nAdditionally, we include in our analysis three measures indicating the\\r\\n\\r\\nsociopolitical dimensions of policy making in the states: the percentage of the state\\r\\npopulation that is black, the level of immigration to the state, and the rate of births\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 633\\r\\n\\r\\nto unmarried mothers. During the earlier wave of retrenchment, racially-defined\\r\\nsystems of political access structured the enactment of work requirements. We\\r\\nexpect that the percentage of the population which is black and the immigration\\r\\nrate should increase the rate of waiver submission. These measures tap into the\\r\\nracial dimensions of the program, testing the claims of Quadagno (1990), Lieberman\\r\\n(1995) and others that racial inequality and conflict have structured welfare state\\r\\ndevelopment in the United States, particularly in the system of public assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nRacialized policy discourses have long plagued the AFDC program (Bell 1965; Soule\\r\\n& Zylan 1997); where a greater share of the population is black, racial conflict may\\r\\nbe exacerbated, and AFDC may become a site of racial politicking.\\r\\nThis consideration of race-based political processes raises a more general point\\r\\nabout how political conflicts may affect policymakers\\' actions. One important\\r\\nperspective on policy development emphasizes the processes of democratic\\r\\nresponsiveness (Page & Shapiro 1983) and dynamic representation (Stimson et al\\r\\n1995). These two principles hold that government policies are responsive to citizen\\r\\n\\r\\npreferences as expressed though public opinion (Page & Shapiro 1983). For\\r\\nexample, we might expect that public opposition to welfare spending drives state\\r\\nand federal welfare retrenchment. When we examine the General Social Survey\\r\\nfor the years in which data on opposition to federal welfare spending is available\\r\\n\\r\\n(1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994) it appears that there might be a relationship between\\r\\nnational-level opposition to federal welfare spending and the number of state-\\r\\n\\r\\nwaivers submitted (see the GSS website http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/gss/trend).\\r\\nHowever, note that the public opinion data from the GSS are not available for 1992,\\r\\n\\r\\na critical year in this phase of welfare retrenchment. More importantly, for our\\r\\nanalysis, public opinion data on relevant questions simply does not exist. In order\\r\\n\\r\\nto examine the arguments advanced by democratic responsiveness theorists, we\\r\\nwould need state-level public opinion data, measured yearly, to adequately test these\\r\\n\\r\\nhypotheses in our study; unfortunately this data is not available. 16\\r\\nOne measure that may indirectly capture democratic responsiveness is a\\r\\n\\r\\nmeasure of immigration in the state. The issue of immigration - legal and\\r\\nnonlegal - has been politicized, racialized, and linked to welfare policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)\\r\\nmaintain websites full of information about why the U.S. should restrict\\r\\nimmigration; one pervasive argument for immigration restriction is that\\r\\nimmigrants are disproportionate users of public assistance. 17 Clearly, this argument\\r\\nmade sense to Congressional welfare reformers, who explicitly restricted immigrants\\'\\r\\nuse of public assistance with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities\\r\\nReconciliation Act. Additionally, in 1995, 56% of people polled favored cutting\\r\\n\\r\\noff public assistance to immigrants who have been in the U.S. for fewer than five\\r\\nyears (Gallup 1995). We hypothesize that states with high levels of immigration\\r\\nwill have higher rates of waiver submission as they attempt to constrict AFDC. As\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c634 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\na measure of states\\' immigration levels, we use the percentage of immigrants\\r\\nadmitted to the U.S. by the intended state of residence.\\r\\nPolicy officials and the public have long expressed concern about the rising\\r\\nincidence of unmarried motherhood, sometimes arguing that welfare benefits\\r\\n\\r\\nencourage women to bear children out of wedlock (Bell 1965; Soule & Zylan 1997).\\r\\nWhere the rate of nonmarital births is high, policy-makers might be more inclined\\r\\n\\r\\nto experiment with policy reforms (such as family caps or categorical exclusions)\\r\\ncommon to the waivers submitted during this period. We use the ratio of births to\\r\\nunmarried women per 1,000 live births (Ventura 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the models presented below, we add to this first block of variables several\\r\\nmeasures indicating the left/right balance of political power. Soule and Zylan (1997)\\r\\nfound that partisanship mattered during the first wave of reform, as non-Southern\\r\\nDemocratic legislators led the enactment of work requirements. We expect party\\r\\naffiliation to again be important, but we hypothesize that Republican-controlled\\r\\nstates were more likely to favor the submission of waivers. While Republicans were\\r\\nnot the only advocates of welfare reform (as our previous discussion of the federal\\r\\npolicy environment suggests), the historical evidence suggests that they may have\\r\\n\\r\\nbeen the leaders of such efforts. Thus we have constructed a single dummy variable\\r\\ncoded one if the state\\'s legislature is controlled by the Republican Party (a majority).\\r\\nNoting the importance of governors in the recent wave of reform (Teles 1996), we\\r\\nalso include a dummy variable for whether or not the state\\'s governor is a\\r\\nRepublican.\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard accounts of welfare state development have emphasized the role of\\r\\nworking class mobilization in the expansion of systems of provision, and one\\r\\naccount of retrenchment offered by Bowles and Gintis (1982) suggests this effect\\r\\nmay be producing a kind of backlash from capital in advanced welfare states.\\r\\nAccording to Bowles and Gintis, it is the very success of labor in securing basic\\r\\n\\r\\nprotections against labor market uncertainty that has produced a dilemma for\\r\\ncapital as it faces new accumulation crises. Thus, the attack on the welfare state\\r\\nmay be capital\\'s attempt to reestablish the terms of labor\\'s exploitation (Bowles &\\r\\nGintis 1982: 91). We hypothesize that retrenchment efforts would therefore be most\\r\\naggressive where labor is strong. We include a measure of union density - the\\r\\nproportion of the nonagricultural labor force organized in unions - to examine\\r\\nthis hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the models presented below, we also include a block of variables that measure\\r\\nelements of the policy environment. First, we directly test the hypothesis that current\\r\\n\\r\\nreform states are not the same states that led the earlier wave of reform by including\\r\\n\\r\\na dummy variable indicating whether or not the state passed a work requirement\\r\\nbetween 1950 and 1967 (Soule & Zylan 1997). Next, we examine the extent to\\r\\nwhich a high per capita AFDC caseload and high AFDC payments drove states to\\r\\nlook for ways to retrench their programs. We hypothesize that states with high AFDC\\r\\n\\r\\ncaseloads should have higher rates of waiver submission, as these states might be\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 635\\r\\n\\r\\nespecially interested in reducing coverage.

We use the per capita transformation of the number of\\r\\n\\r\\nAFDC cases to control for differences in state population. We also indude a measure\\r\\nof the average AFDC payment in the state. In a period of federal de-funding, states\\r\\nwith high benefits might have sought waivers as a form of state-based problem\\r\\n\\r\\nsolving or \"puzzling\" (Heclo 1974), seeking to reduce overall expenditures on the\\r\\nprogram by reducing caseloads rather than benefits. Such states may have viewed\\r\\nthe submission of AFDC waivers as a way to retain high quality programs of\\r\\nassistance in an environment of growing budgetary austerity.\\r\\nOther aspects of the policy environment constitute the heart of the \"new\\r\\n\\r\\npolitics\" model proffered by Pierson and colleagues. Thus, our analysis includes a\\r\\nnumber of measures designed to indicate the political dimensions of policy legacies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we examine Pierson\\'s claim that high levels of visible taxation may produce\\r\\nprogram vulnerability and therefore enhance retrenchment efforts (Pierson 1994).\\r\\nIf this is true, we would expect to see a positive relationship between state-level\\r\\nincome taxation and waiver activity. As tax revenues are extremely variable, we\\r\\n\\r\\nexpect trends in taxation to be more important to retrenchment politics than their\\r\\nlevel in any given year. Thus, we include a measure of the change in state income\\r\\ntax receipts per capita, taking the change over the three years prior to the year of\\r\\nobservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext we examine Pierson\\'s claim that aspects of the policy environment create\\r\\npolitical constraints on the enactment of potential reforms. Specifically, he argues\\r\\nthat preexisting policies produce political constituencies of their own. Members\\r\\nof the voting public are often recipients of the benefits provided by state policies.\\r\\nEven as there may be a generalized public distaste for \"welfare,\" the public is\\r\\nunlikely to welcome cuts in the programs they enjoy. A program can become more\\r\\nvulnerable than others in a time of political conservatism if its beneficiaries are\\r\\nnot well mobilized, not particularly plentiful, or not aligned with the beneficiaries\\r\\n\\r\\nof another, more protected program. The recipients of AFDC have, with the\\r\\nexception of one brief period at the end of the 1960s, never been well-mobilized\\r\\nin their own defense. Thus we need to look at the constituents of collateral policies\\r\\nto understand the context of policy-related interests within which AFDC reform\\r\\nwas undertaken. As the above discussion of Reagan\\'s retrenchment efforts at the\\r\\nfederal level suggests, the resistance of Social Security recipients could waylay\\r\\n\\r\\nattempts to make cuts in that program, leading reformers to look elsewhere for\\r\\nretrenchment targets. Pierson notes that unemployment benefits and AFDC\\r\\n\\r\\nspending were particularly vulnerable in this sense, as they were decentralized and\\r\\ncould fall victim to the forces of interstate competition (Pierson 1994: 101).

We anticipate, therefore, that the fate of AFDC may have been\\r\\n\\r\\ndirectly tied to the fate of Unemployment Insurance and inversely related to the\\r\\nstrength of Social Security in the state. We include measures of the number of\\r\\n\\r\\nrecipients in each program, controlled for the state population.\\r\\nTHE SUSCEPTIBILITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning from intrastate to interstate mechanisms of retrenchment, we next\\r\\nconsider the possibility that some states are more susceptible to the diffusion of\\r\\n\\r\\npolicy innovations than other states. Discerning whether or not a characteristic of\\r\\na state increases its rate of submission of a waiver or increases its susceptibility to\\r\\nthe diffusion waivers (or both) is not always immediately obvious or intuitive. Many\\r\\nof the measures described in the previous section (propensity effects) might also\\r\\naffect a state\\'s susceptibility to the diffusion of waivers. Since in the diffusion model\\r\\n\\r\\ndescribed above, a variable can have an effect in multiple vectors, \"final model\\r\\nspecification should be preceded by exploratory analysis that includes variables in\\r\\nboth propensity and susceptibility vectors\" (Davis & Greve 1997:20). The models\\r\\npresented below reflect the final specifications after extensive exploratory analysis.18\\r\\n\\r\\nWe suspect that the susceptibility of a state to a diffusing innovation such as\\r\\nthe submission of waivers may have been affected by the fiscal concerns of the\\r\\nstate. Many states faced fiscal crises during the early 1990s as a result of the\\r\\nrecession, high spending during the eighties, and the federalist practices of the\\r\\n\\r\\nReagan and Bush administrations (Gold 1995; Pierson 1994). We hypothesize that\\r\\nstates facing severe fiscal imbalances may have sought ways to cut back on\\r\\n\\r\\nexpenditures (O\\'Connor 1973; Offe 1984). AFDC waivers were designed to do just\\r\\nthat and may have seemed an attractive policy option to financially ailing states.\\r\\nWe expect that there may have been a threshold effect whereby states facing extreme\\r\\n\\r\\nfiscal crises were more vulnerable to \"catchy\" policy innovations pursued by other\\r\\nstates. To measure this, we have constructed a dummy variable coded one if the\\r\\nstate is facing one of the ten most severe fiscal imbalances, and zero if it is not one\\r\\n\\r\\nof these top ten.19 To measure fiscal crisis, we subtract the total state expenditures\\r\\nfrom the total state revenues and divide this figure by the state revenues.\\r\\nTHE INFECTIOUSNESS VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nIf some states are particularly susceptible to diffusion, others may be especially\\r\\ninfluential in the spread of new policies. One of the distinct advantages of the model\\r\\nused in this paper is its ability to specify which states\\' actions mean the most to the\\r\\n\\r\\ndecisions of other states. Davis and Greve (1997) describe the process by which\\r\\ncertain referents are chosen by individual organizations. We seek to do the same\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c638 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nhere. We ask, much like these authors did for organizations, which states are more\\r\\nlikely to legitimate this particular form of social policy.\\r\\nWe hypothesize that states that are known as traditional innovators are more\\r\\ninfluential to this process than are other states. States that are thought of historically\\r\\nas innovators are more likely to be watched, in a sense, and copied by others. Robert\\r\\nEyestone (1977) suggests that there may be what he terms a \"segmented emulation\\r\\nprocess\" of innovation (Eyestone 1977: 442). A given policy must first be adopted\\r\\n\\r\\nby recognized leader states (or those that have historically or traditionally been\\r\\ninnovative with regard to different policies), then it is adopted as a consequence of\\r\\n\\r\\ndiffusion from leader to follower states (Eyestone 1977: 442).2o Hence we expect\\r\\nthat a waiver submission by one of the most innovative states ought to increase the\\r\\nrate of submission for all other states. To measure this, we use Walker\\'s (1969)\\r\\ninnovation score.21\\r\\nTHE DIFFUSION VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nAs noted earlier, one of the most common findings in diffusion research is that\\r\\nactors that are dose to one another tend to influence one another. Strang and Soule\\r\\n(1998) note that geographic proximity is likely to increase interaction and that\\r\\n\\r\\ngeographically proximal actors are likely to be the most aware of one another.\\r\\nAdditionally, the policy innovation literature is rife with references to the regional\\r\\ndiffusion of policies (See Berry 1994 for a review). Simply put, the regional diffusion\\r\\nargument posits that the probability of a state enacting a certain policy is increased\\r\\nwhen states within the same region have already enacted it. We use the U.S. Bureau\\r\\nof the Census-defined regions in oar analysis in an attempt to ascertain whether\\r\\nor not the submission of waivers diffused within geographic region.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults and Discussion\\r\\nTHE PROPENSITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nTable 2 summarizes the results of models designed to ascertain which intrinsic\\r\\n\\r\\ncharacteristics of states lead to higher rates of waiver request submission. In the\\r\\nlanguage of Soule and Zylan (1997) and Berry (1994), these are the \"intrastate\"\\r\\neffects. These models test hypotheses derived from recent studies of welfare\\r\\nretrenchment by Pierson and colleagues (Myles & Pierson 1997; Pierson 1995;\\r\\n1996) and by Soule and Zylan (1997).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the socioeconomic and demographic variables we include in\\r\\nthe analysis, we first note the positive coefficient on our measure of the service\\r\\nsector. This coefficient is significant in the first two of the three models, suggesting\\r\\n\\r\\nthat there is indeed a \"logic of postindustrialism\" driving retrenching reforms. If\\r\\nwe interpret the coefficient on this measure in Model 1, for example, we find that\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 639\\r\\n\\r\\nan increase from the mean value of this variable to the maximum value of this\\r\\nvariable yields an increase in the multiplier on the rate of waiver submission from\\r\\n\\r\\n1.6 to 4.4. It should be noted, however, that this effect washes out with the inclusion\\r\\nof policy environment variables in Model 3 of Table 2, which suggests that the\\r\\nevolution of the economy may be important only to the extent that it produces\\r\\nextensive welfare state commitments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find similar results for the coefficient on immigration.22 While high\\r\\nimmigration levels do positively affect waiver submission as we hypothesized\\r\\n(models 1 and 2), this effect appears to be mediated by the policy environment in\\r\\n\\r\\nthe state (model 3). It, like our measure of the service sector, loses significance\\r\\nwhen we include the policy environment variables. This is true, as well, of our\\r\\nmeasure of the nonmarital birth rate. Surprisingly, this coefficient is negative in\\r\\n\\r\\nall three models, suggesting that, contrary to the rhetoric surrounding AFDC, states\\r\\nwith relatively low levels of unmarried motherhood were fastest to submit waivers.\\r\\nThe magnitude of this effect is small, but the direction of the relationship remains\\r\\n\\r\\nconsistent across the models.23\\r\\nIn Table 2 we also find a strong, positive, and significant effect of the racial\\r\\ncomposition of the population. Specifically, states with relatively large black\\r\\npopulations were fastest to submit waivers.24 The effect of this variable holds across\\r\\n\\r\\nall models, indicating that racial dynamics were a significant factor in the\\r\\nretrenchment process. The magnitude of the coefficient of this measure is also quite\\r\\n\\r\\nhigh. In model 3, it is 8.24, for example. This means that increasing the black\\r\\npopulation from 10% to 50% increases the multiplier on the rate of waiver\\r\\nsubmission from 2.3 to 61.5, an enormous increase. This finding echoes that of\\r\\nSoule and Zylan (1997) for the earlier wave of AFDC reform. While a democratic\\r\\nresponsiveness interpretation of the immigration and racial composition of the\\r\\n\\r\\npopulation seems eminently plausible - that is, where immigration is high and\\r\\nthe relative percentage of African Americans is high, welfare \"backlash\" results\\r\\nas we noted in an earlier footnote, our direct measure of ideological orientation\\r\\n\\r\\nwas not significant in any of our models (results not shown). It did, however,\\r\\noperate in the predicted direction. Thus, we are unable to rule out the possibility\\r\\nthat public opinion is at least partially driving waiver submission.\\r\\nTurning now to political-institutional characteristics of states, in model 2 of\\r\\nTable 2 we add measures of the composition of the state legislature, the partisanship\\r\\nof the governor, and the density of union membership in the state. The coefficients\\r\\non the Republican legislature and Republican governor measures are both positive\\r\\nand significant. If parties to the left of the political spectrum have been most\\r\\n\\r\\ninfluential in promoting the initiation and expansion of programs of social\\r\\nprovision (Amenta & Poulsen 1996; Esping-Andersen 1985, 1990; Korpi 1980),\\r\\n\\r\\nthen policies contracting social provision may reasonably be expected to emerge\\r\\nfrom the right of the political spectrum. Here we find evidence that they have.25\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c640 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\nTABLE 3: Diffusion of Waiver Submission, 1989-1995\\r\\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\\r\\nPropensity oX\\r\\nIntercept -6.31*** -6.11*** -6.35*** -6.30***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.67) (.79) (.65) (.64)\\r\\nPercentblackpopulation 7.88*** 4.71*** 8.21*** 4.96***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.96) (.91) (.98) (.92)\\r\\nPercent Republican legislators 1.83*** 1.84*** 1.97*** 1.80***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.50) (.47) (.49) (.49)\\r\\nRepublican governor .62*** .44*** .59*** .35**\\r\\n(.13) (.12) (.13) (.12)\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion density .01** .02** .01* .02*\\r\\n(.005) (.005) (.005) (.007)\\r\\n\\r\\nWork requirement passed -.40** -.44** -.34** -.50***\\r\\n(1950-67)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\nAverageAFDC payments 31.99*** 25.58*** 36.59*** 28.48***\\r\\n\\r\\n(4.69) (4.58) (4.82) (4.73)\\r\\nAFDC recipients per capita 3.29** 4.40*** 3.27*** 4.37***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.89) (.89) (.89) (.89)\\r\\nChange in state taxes (3 years) 4.23*** 3.75*** 4.40*** 4.02***\\r\\n(1.22) (1.28) (1.23) (1.30)\\r\\nUnemploy. insur. recip.\\r\\nper capita -54.56*** -42.04*** -57.53*** -42.32***\\r\\n\\r\\n(7.96) (7.97) (7.94) (7.99)\\r\\nSoc. sec. recipients per capita 10.73*** 7.12*** 9.45** 6.91*\\r\\n\\r\\n(3.68) (3.47) (3.62) (3.42)\\r\\nSusceptibility *\\r\\nIntercept .01*** .01*** .01*** .01***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.001) (.001) (.001) (.001)\\r\\n\\r\\nFiscal\\r\\n\\r\\ncrisis\\r\\n\\r\\n.005***\\r\\n(.0002)\\r\\n\\r\\n.01***\\r\\n(.0005)\\r\\n\\r\\nInfectiousness y\\r\\n\\r\\nWalker innovation score .60*** .60***\\r\\n(.04)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.04)\\r\\n\\r\\nDiffusion 8\\r\\n\\r\\nGeographic\\r\\n\\r\\n.02***\\r\\n\\r\\n.01**\\r\\n(.003) (.004)\\r\\n\\r\\nLikelihood ratio 2 VS.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstant Rate Model 586.01 886.23 600.03 896.01\\r\\ndf\\r\\n\\r\\n13\\r\\n\\r\\n13\\r\\n\\r\\n13\\r\\n\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\nNote.

This finding\\r\\nlends support to Bowles and Gintis\\'s (1982) claim that an attack on welfare may\\r\\nbe, in part, capital\\'s backlash against the traditional working class mobilization in\\r\\n\\r\\nsupport of welfare expansion.\\r\\nIn model 3 we include indicators of the policy environment within which\\r\\n\\r\\nwaivers were considered. Not surprisingly, states with heavy caseloads were quick\\r\\nto submit waivers designed to dramatically contract the scope of the AFDC program.\\r\\nThe coefficient on AFDC recipients is positive and significant. If we interpret this\\r\\ncoefficient, we find that the multiplier on the mean value of our measure of AFDC\\r\\nrecipients is 1.23, but at the maximum value it is 6.66. Thus, the multiplier increases\\r\\nby almost six-fold when we move from the mean to the maximum number of\\r\\nAFDC recipients per capita (based on the coefficient in model 3).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe a similar relationship between benefit levels and waiver submission:\\r\\nstates that offered higher AFDC payments were also in the forefront of waiver\\r\\nsubmission. The magnitude of this coefficient is again quite large. In Model 3, for\\r\\nexample, increasing the benefits from the mean value to the maximum value yields\\r\\nan increase in the multiplier on the rate of submission from 7.7 to 44.6.\\r\\nAdditionally, states that had submitted a work requirement in the 1950s had\\r\\nslower rates of waiver submission, indicating that in fact the states submitting\\r\\nwaivers were different states than those that passed work requirements in the earlier\\r\\nwave of retrenchment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in model 3 of Table 2, we examine trends in state income taxation and\\r\\nwaiver submission; we find the coefficient on this measure to be positive and\\r\\nsignificant. Highly visible taxation may have led to a welfare backlash in some states,\\r\\n\\r\\na finding that supports one dimension of Pierson\\'s new politics model. As\\r\\nmentioned earlier, Pierson\\'s model also stresses the importance of program-based\\r\\nconstituencies over traditional social deavages in welfare retrenchment. In model 3,\\r\\nwe find very strong support for Pierson\\'s contention that welfare state programs\\r\\n\\r\\ncreate electoral constituencies that shape the political calculus governing\\r\\nretrenchment. The number of Unemployment Insurance recipients is negatively\\r\\nand significantly related to waiver submission, while the coefficient on our measure\\r\\nof Social Security recipients is positive and significant.26 As predicted, we find that\\r\\nAFDC programs were protected in states with extensive Unemployment Insurance\\r\\nprograms and were made vulnerable in states with extensive Social Security\\r\\n\\r\\nprograms. Pierson\\'s claim that retrenchment is structured by the political\\r\\nconsequences of program participation is persuasive given these findings. If we\\r\\ninterpret the coefficients on these two measures in model 3, we find that an increase\\r\\nfrom the minimum value of Unemployment Insurance recipients per capita to\\r\\n\\r\\nthe maximum value, means a 21-fold decrease in the multiplier on the rate of\\r\\nwaiver submission (the multiplier decreases from .85 at the minimum to .04 at\\r\\nthe maximum). With respect to Social Security recipients, if we increase from the\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c642 I Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nmean number of recipients per capita to the maximum number, the multiplier\\r\\nincreases from 5.81 to 10.44, or almost doubles.\\r\\nWhen taken together, the results presented in Table 2 indicate that the processes\\r\\n\\r\\nspurring the most recent wave of welfare retrenchment bear strong similarities to\\r\\n\\r\\nthe processes driving the earlier wave of reform. Racial dynamics, 27 partisanship,\\r\\nand the policy environment were again important in predicting which states would\\r\\nsubmit waivers. Yet the states leading the recent reform wave were not the same\\r\\nstates that had led the earlier wave; there is a significant, negative coefficient on the\\r\\nmeasure indicating whether the state had passed a work requirement during the\\r\\nfirst wave. We also find that Republicans replaced Democrats as the party members\\r\\nleading retrenchment efforts in the states.28 Nonetheless, even as these change agents\\r\\nwere not the same, the essential political and institutional mechanisms driving\\r\\nretrenchment have changed little since the late 1950s and early 1960s.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetrenchment in Aid to Families with Dependent Children remains a process\\r\\nundertaken in a context of heavy program demands, racial conflict, and partisan\\r\\npolitics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the results in Table 2 demonstrate the continued importance of\\r\\noverall social policy environments in structuring retrenchment. We find\\r\\nparticularly strong support for Pierson\\'s contention that preexisting policies create\\r\\n\\r\\na treacherous political playing field for would-be reformers. An increasing tax\\r\\nrevenue base may create a public demand for relief in the form of broad-based\\r\\nwelfare reform, but specific cuts are more perilously negotiated by elected officials.\\r\\nSocial policies produce potential defenders as well as critics; defenders come in\\r\\nthe guise of those who enjoy program-based benefits.\\r\\nTHE SUSCEPTIBILITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving examined the intrastate mechanisms of retrenchment, we now add\\r\\nmeasures to test for the effects of interstate diffusion. Table 3 presents results of\\r\\nmodels in which we have added the susceptibility, infectiousness and diffusion\\r\\nvectors to a pared-down propensity vector shown in Table 2. In particular, we remove\\r\\n\\r\\nthe three measures that lose significance in model 3 of Table 2, immigration levels,\\r\\nservice sector, and birth rate to unmarried women.29\\r\\nAll of the propensity indicators operate as they did in model 3 of Table 2. In\\r\\nmodel 1, we add to the propensity vector a measure of susceptibility: the extent to\\r\\nwhich the state is experiencing fiscal crisis. Did fiscal crisis make a state more\\r\\n\\r\\nsusceptible to the idea of waivers once they had begun to diffuse? Our findings\\r\\nindicate that it did; the coefficient on the fiscal crisis measure is positive and\\r\\nsignificant. This measure is categorical in nature; the ten states with the most severe\\r\\n\\r\\nimbalances between expenditures and revenues are coded 1, while all other states\\r\\nare coded 0. Therefore, this finding suggests a threshold effect: at relatively severe\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 643\\r\\n\\r\\nlevels of fiscal crisis, states were more susceptible to the diffusion of policies of\\r\\nretrenchment.\\r\\nTHE INFECTIOUSNESS VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nIn model 2, we examine whether or not some states were more likely to serve as\\r\\nreferents to other states. We find that this was indeed the case; innovative states\\r\\n\\r\\nwere more influential actors and their actions were likely to be followed by others.\\r\\nThis lends support to the argument of Eyestone (1977) that the actions of traditional\\r\\n\\r\\ninnovators are likely to be considered legitimate, and that follower states are likely\\r\\nto follow their lead regardless of the nature of the innovation in question. By\\r\\nfollowing innovators, states bolster a different dimension of legitimacy: that which\\r\\n\\r\\nis derived from enacting their roles as followers, pragmatists, or laggards.30\\r\\nTHE DIFFUSION VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, in model 3 of Table 3, we include a measure designed to capture any\\r\\nregional diffusion effects: the U.S. Bureau of the Census-defined region in which a\\r\\nstate is located. We find evidence for regional diffusion: the submission of a waiver\\r\\n\\r\\ndiffused across states that are geographically proximate. This lends support to the\\r\\nidea that actors in geographically proximate states are more likely to communicate,\\r\\nor at least to be aware of one another\\'s actions (Strang & Soule 1998).31\\r\\nModel 4 of Table 3 includes all three diffusion vectors along with the propensity\\r\\n\\r\\nvector, providing a final, synthetic model of retrenchment in AFDC. The model\\r\\nindicates that political and institutional factors were most important in determining\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich states would be fastest to submit waivers. The policy environment emerges\\r\\nas a crucial feature of the retrenchment process, as do measures testing Pierson\\'s\\r\\nmodel. Finally, we find evidence of all three aspects of the diffusion process: states\\r\\nexperiencing fiscal crisis are more susceptible to the diffusion of waivers, there is\\r\\ngeographic diffusion of waivers, and traditional innovators are more infectious to\\r\\nthe diffusion process.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nAid to Families with Dependent Children has been a politically contentious\\r\\nprogram of social provision since the early 1950s, when states initiated the first\\r\\nmajor effort to reform the program and trim state responsibilities toward poor\\r\\nwomen and children through the enactment of punitive, restrictive eligibility\\r\\nrequirements. A similar reform wave emerged in the late 1980s, as states again\\r\\nsought to contract social provision by enacting dramatic revisions in their AFDC\\r\\nprograms. However, even as the content of the reforms passed during the first wave\\r\\n\\r\\nwas similar to the content of the reforms passed during the second wave, different\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c644 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nstates and a different party were in the forefront of policy innovation during each\\r\\nwave. While this suggests - on its face - a \"new politics of the welfare state\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe find that the mechanisms driving retrenchment remain fundamentally the\\r\\nsame: partisan politics, racial conflict, and rapid diffusion of the reforms once they\\r\\nbegin to be pursued. Perhaps, as well, some of the impetus for change in the AFDC\\r\\nprogram emerged from shifts in public opinion that made the program particularly\\r\\nsalient as a target for cuts. Certainly the racialized discourse of welfare and welfare\\r\\nreform cannot be ignored as elements of the state retrenchment story.\\r\\nYet all of these mechanisms have operated in the context of particular policy\\r\\nenvironments, and in this sense Pierson and colleagues are correct that there are\\r\\n\\r\\nsome important new institutional elements that must be accounted for in any\\r\\ndiscussion of contemporary welfare politics. In effect, the pressure to reform seems\\r\\nto have come from above and below. The characteristics of the AFDC program itself\\r\\nhave been paramount: states that were facing high benefit levels and/or high recipient\\r\\nrates were fastest to submit waivers designed to radically contract the scope of AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find that institutional characteristics and political dynamics were tightly\\r\\nconnected in retrenchment processes. The configuration of program-derived\\r\\n\\r\\npolitical interests clearly structured the submission of waivers. In the face of\\r\\nextensive citizen participation in the Social Security program, reformers set their\\r\\nsights on the vulnerable public assistance system. Extensive participation in\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment Insurance, on the other hand, could help shield AFDC from the\\r\\ngathering storm of welfare \"backlash\" - itself, in part, a product of increasingly\\r\\nvisible taxation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the \"new politics\" model a dramatic departure from existing theories of the\\r\\nstate and social policy development - or can it be reconciled with those theories?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe suggest the latter conclusion. For one thing, we find echoes of the political/\\r\\ninstitutional account of Pierson and colleagues in the political/institutional account\\r\\nof welfare state expansion offered by some state-centered scholars (Amenta &\\r\\nPoulsen 1996; Amenta, Carruthers & Zylan 1992; Cauthen & Amenta 1996). At\\r\\nthe heart of that account is the intersection of political dynamics (including partisan\\r\\n\\r\\nadvocacy) and the structure of state institutions (induding the shape of preexisting\\r\\npolicy commitments, experiences, and frameworks). Once a simple \"mirror\\r\\nimage\" assumption is dispensed with, we find that the \"new politics\" and\\r\\n\\r\\n\"institutional politics\" theories have much in common.\\r\\nSecond, our analysis suggests the continued relevance of the literature on the\\r\\ndiffusion of innovations. Even as the content of innovation was in this case the\\r\\n\\r\\ncontraction of social provision rather than its expansion, we find striking\\r\\nsimilarities between the diffusion processes characterizing retrenchment and those\\r\\nthat have been identified in studies of expansion. In particular, we find that\\r\\ninnovativeness remains a salient feature of states that structures the diffusion of\\r\\n\\r\\npolicies. States tend to look toward the most innovative states whether they are\\r\\nadopting expansive or restrictive policies. Geographic proximity also operates to\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 645\\r\\n\\r\\nfoster diffusion, and this echoes the findings of previous researchers. Finally, we\\r\\nfind that, as predicted by the literature on innovations, some actors are more\\r\\n\\r\\nsusceptible to the diffusion of new policy instruments than others.\\r\\nIn sum, we suggest that contemporary developments in welfare state politics\\r\\n\\r\\nand policy may be viewed as a continuation of, rather than a radical departure\\r\\nfrom, the history of welfare state politics and policy in the United States and\\r\\n\\r\\nelsewhere. At the very least, recent efforts to \"end welfare as we know it\" have a\\r\\ndecidedly familiar ring to them. While Republicans have had greater success than\\r\\ntheir post-World War II Democratic counterparts in translating their reforms into\\r\\n\\r\\ndecisive national action, they cannot lay claim to originality in their efforts. The\\r\\nnames have changed, but the story remains very much the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\n1. During the first phase of reform, work was required by the institution of a new\\r\\neligibility rule in many states; attempts were made to exclude never married mothers\\r\\nand \"illegitimate\" children. Additionally, existing \"suitable home\" and \"substitute parent\"\\r\\nrules - which provided for the cessation of benefits if a home was deemed unsuitable\\r\\nfor the children, or if a man was discovered in the home of a recipient mother - were\\r\\nmore aggressively enforced through the creation of investigative units which practiced\\r\\n\\r\\nsurveillance of recipients. During the most recent phase of reform, work requirements\\r\\nhave been beefed up through the implementation of time limits and new, tighter\\r\\nexemption rules; teenage parents and recipients who bear children while receiving\\r\\nassistance have been the targets of categorical exclusion. Additionally, new mechanisms\\r\\n\\r\\nenforcing paternity identification and support have been widely implemented.\\r\\n2. One important difference between the two phases of reform is worth mentioning\\r\\nearly in the analysis. During the first wave, states were operating in the absence of federal\\r\\nguidelines about the kinds of changes they might be able to make in their programs\\r\\nwithout incurring federal penalties. Recall that the programs themselves had been\\r\\noperating for a mere ten years in most states, fewer than ten in other states. The Social\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity Board maintained a hands-off policy during the early years of the program\\'s\\r\\nexistence, recognizing the limitations of its power, which was all stick and no carrot.\\r\\n(A program violating the Board\\'s criteria for approval could have its federal matching\\r\\n\\r\\nfunds withdrawn. Federal officials were naturally reluctant to take such a step unless\\r\\nconfronted with severe violations of the spirit of Title IV of the Social Security Act.)\\r\\nA series of Social Security Board rulings in the early 1960s eventually clarified the federal\\r\\npolicy environment for states seeking to reform their ADC programs (Steiner 1966).\\r\\nPrior to this time, however, state reformers demonstrated considerable willingness to\\r\\n\\r\\ntest the policy water - probably because the broadly worded mandates of the Social\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity Act gave them little reason to think changes at the margins of their programs\\r\\nwould create violations. During the second wave, reformers were encouraged by the\\r\\nactions of three successive federal administrations inviting state-level innovation. We\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspect that the different environments operated similarly in providing an open forum\\r\\n\\r\\nfor states to initiate policy changes. Differences may have manifested themselves (if at\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c646 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\nall) in the content of reforms attempted in the states. Any systematic comparison between\\r\\nthe two phases of reform would have to take into consideration the different federal\\r\\nenvironments within which the states operated during the two phases of reform. We do\\r\\n\\r\\nnot seek to produce such a comparison here. Rather, we seek to isolate the factors within\\r\\nand between states driving their decisions about whether and when to submit waivers.\\r\\nFor these purposes, a more circumscribed discussion of the role of the federal\\r\\ngovernment will suffice (see below). We thank an anonymous reviewer at Social Forces\\r\\n\\r\\nfor pointing out the importance of considering longitudinal variation in the federal policy\\r\\nenvironment for researchers interested in explaining the overall story of retrenchment in\\r\\nAFDC, a federalized program of social provision. Although we do not attempt that project\\r\\nhere, we concur that it is essential if we are to fully understand retrenchment processes.\\r\\n3. For reviews of existing theories of welfare state development, see Berry (1994), Skocpol\\r\\nand Amenta (1986), and Soule and Zylan (1997).\\r\\n\\r\\n4.. We should not, however, the widely recognized political vulnerability of the poor,\\r\\nwhich may render this distinction somewhat meaningless.\\r\\n5. This, of course, is similar to arguments made by new institutionalists about mimetic\\r\\n\\r\\nisomorphism. See the many essays in Powell and DiMaggio\\'s (1991) edited volume which\\r\\naddress pressures organizations face toward isomorphism.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.. Bane\\'s article in The American Prospect suggests the extent to which there was general\\r\\nagreement within the Democratically-appointed Department of Health and Human\\r\\n\\r\\nServices about the desirability of extending waivers to the states. This is significant, since\\r\\nprotecting federal authority over public assistance programs had been a hallmark of\\r\\nDemocratic social policy since the Roosevelt Administration.\\r\\n7. It is not surprising that most reform packages that emerged during this reform wave\\r\\n\\r\\n(as well as the earlier wave) were rather similar in content. Paul Burstein and colleagues\\r\\nhave argued that variation in policy ideas and proposals can be very limited (Burstein,\\r\\n\\r\\net al 1995). It is likely that diffusion processes are at least partly responsible for the\\r\\nsimilarity in reform packages found across space and over time.\\r\\n8. The earned income disregard is the amount of money a recipient can earn per month\\r\\nbefore having some or all additional earnings deducted from the amount of the AFDC\\r\\nbenefit check.\\r\\n9. Variations on this model have been used recently by Greve (1995), Davis and Greve\\r\\n\\r\\n(1997), Soule (1995, 1997), Soule (forthcoming), and Soule and Zylan (1997). It has\\r\\nalso been described in Strang and Soule (1998).\\r\\n10. Often, n is referred to as the potential adopter and s as the transmitter.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Note that we do not use the date of adoption, which varied from state to state\\r\\naccording to many (exogenous) factors, including the rapidity with which federal agencies\\r\\nprocessed waiver requests.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. The Hudson Institute cites the following source: U.S. Department of Health and\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman Services, ACF-Section 1115 Waiver Authority, October 1, 1996 Summary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 647\\r\\n13. The address for the APWA is: http://www.apwa.org.\\r\\n14. These are available on the DHHS website: http://www.os.dhhs.gov.\\r\\n15. Traditional regression diagnostics were performed on our data to test for, in\\r\\nparticular, the presence of collinearity among our covariates. Our diagnostics showed\\r\\nthat collinearity was not a problem.\\r\\n16.However, as a proxy for this, we include Wright et al.\\'s (1985) measure of the percentage\\r\\n\\r\\nof liberal voters in the state (results not shown). These authors argue that their measure,\\r\\nwhich is based on survey data, adequately characterizes the ideology of the state.\\r\\n17. FAIR\\'s address is http://www.fairus.org.\\r\\n18. To do this, we ran models with our measures included in both the propensity and\\r\\n\\r\\nthe susceptibility vectors and in each of the vectors separately. We found that most of\\r\\n\\r\\nour measures had effects in the propensity, but not the susceptibility, vector.\\r\\n19. In preliminary analyses, we tested the possibility that there was a simple, linear, inverse\\r\\nrelationship between the level of state-based resources and waiver submission by including\\r\\n\\r\\na measure of state revenues in the propensity vector. When entered along with the other\\r\\n\\r\\nvariables in the model, the coefficient was positive and not significant.\\r\\n20.It is important to note that we are not making the argument that historically innovative\\r\\n\\r\\nstates are, net of other factors, more quick to submit waivers. This would be a propensity\\r\\nvector argument and, in fact, has been made by Soule and Zylan (1997). Here, we are\\r\\n\\r\\ntesting Eyestone\\'s (1977) contention that historical or traditional innovators are more\\r\\nlikely to serve as referents to others; their actions are more likely to be copied than others.\\r\\n21.In addition to Walker\\'s (1969) score, we also tried Savage\\'s (1978) score. The results\\r\\nwere consistent with what is reported below.\\r\\n\\r\\n22. Concerned that California and New York (which receive the lion\\'s share of immigrants\\r\\neach year during our period) were biasing these results, we ran these models excluding\\r\\nthese two states. The coefficient on our measure of immigration remains positive and\\r\\nsignificant even when these two states are excluded.\\r\\n\\r\\n23. It is possible that the effect of unmarried motherhood rates is operating through\\r\\nbenefit levels. Previous research has shown that high benefit states typically have low\\r\\nrates of nonmarital birth (Zylan 1994).\\r\\n\\r\\n24. In these models, we also included the percentage of the AFDC recipient population\\r\\nthat is black (not shown). The coefficient on this measure was positive, but never\\r\\nsignificant.\\r\\n\\r\\n25. It is interesting to note, however, that Soule and Zylan (1997) find the opposite in\\r\\ntheir paper on the earlier wave of retrenchment in AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\n26. All of the models that include our measure of Unemployment Insurance recipients\\r\\nwere run with the state unemployment rate (not shown). In all cases, the coefficient on\\r\\nthe unemployment rate was not significant and its inclusion did not alter the effect of\\r\\nUnemployment Insurance recipients.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c648 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\nAPPENDIX\\r\\n\\r\\nVariable and Measurement Notes Source\\r\\n\\r\\nService Sector Receipts Divided by the Service Sector data come from Statistical AbGross State Product (GSP).

SOULE, University of Arizona\\r\\n\\r\\nAbstract\\r\\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children fell victim\\r\\nto a dramatic retrenchment as states submitted waivers, or permission slips to experiment\\r\\n\\r\\nwith their public assistance programs by implementing new methods of exclusion and\\r\\nregulation. We find that Republican states were quick to submitfederal waivers to the\\r\\nthe AFDC program, as were states with high AFDC payments. As Soule and Zylan\\r\\n(1997) found in their study of an earlier wave of welfare retrenchment in the U.S.,\\r\\nstates with higher minority group populations and heavier AFDC caseloads were quick\\r\\nto pass waivers. Following Pierson (1994, 1996), we find that states with an increasing\\r\\ntax revenue base and with a high proportion of Social Security recipients were quick to\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmit waivers, while states with a high proportion of Unemployment Insurance\\r\\nrecipients were slow to do so. We also find evidencefor the geographic diffusion of waiver\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmission and that states experiencingfiscal crisis were more susceptible to the diffusing\\r\\n\\r\\nof waivers. Finally, wefind that states which are traditionally innovative with regard\\r\\nto policy decisions served as referents to other states puzzling over whether or not to\\r\\nsubmit waivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents of welfare reform in the U.S. were little surprised when Bill Clinton\\r\\npledged in 1992 to \"end welfare as we know it\"and fewer were surprised that what\\r\\nhe meant by that was ending entitlement to public assistance under Aid to Families\\r\\nwith Dependent Children (AFDC). The AFDC program has been the focus of the\\r\\ndiscourse of welfare reform for more than forty years, and this discourse was\\r\\n* The authors would like to thank Elisabeth Clemens, Paula England, Don Grant, Henrich Greve,\\r\\nLinda Molm, and Marc Schneiberg for comments on an earlier version of this paper, Irenee\\r\\nBeattie, Karen Christopher, and Jennifer Murdock for research support, and David Strang for\\r\\n\\r\\nuse of his SAS-IML Routines for the analysis.

In\\r\\nthe late 1980s and 1990s, an even more dramatic rollback of public assistance\\r\\noccurred, with the implementation of new mechanisms of exclusion and regulation\\r\\n\\r\\nand the introduction of time limits: the first step toward ending the entitlement\\r\\nstatus of one of the central titles of the American welfare state.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the discursive similarities between these two phases of welfare reform,\\r\\nthere were substantive parallels as well. During both phases, policy changes were\\r\\n\\r\\ninitially most dramatic at the state level. New program initiatives were undertaken\\r\\nby the states in an effort to enforce work among recipients, to exclude certain types\\r\\n\\r\\nof applicants for assistance, and to establish new mechanisms of surveillance.1\\r\\nDuring both phases, these state-level policy innovations were eventually\\r\\nincorporated into national legislation. Given the apparent similarities in content\\r\\n\\r\\nof these two phases of welfare reform, one might expect similar factors to have\\r\\nproduced them. In predicting adoption rates for the earlier wave of reform, Soule\\r\\n\\r\\nand Zylan (1997) found that a number of processes were at work. First, states with\\r\\nheavy caseloads, racially restricted political access, stingy old age assistance\\r\\nprograms, and an absence of maternalist state advocates had higher rates of adoption\\r\\n\\r\\nof punitive work requirements. In short, those states characterized by the poor\\r\\nincorporation of African Americans into the polity, high recipient rates, and a lack\\r\\nof benefit generosity in their programs of social provision were in the forefront of\\r\\nadoption. Partisanship played a role as well; the authors note with some surprise\\r\\nthe significance of Democratic leadership in the adoption of work requirements.\\r\\nDemocrats may have been adopting a partisan stance of policy innovativeness; net\\r\\n\\r\\nof all other characteristics, states with a history of policy innovation were faster to\\r\\n\\r\\nadopt work requirements than less innovative states. The authors also found\\r\\nevidence of institutional and cultural diffusion.\\r\\nA quick glance at the pattern of submission of federal waivers in the AFDC\\r\\nprogram during the most recent wave of reform suggests that different kinds of\\r\\n\\r\\nstates may have been leading the way. Since the late 1980s, states have applied for\\r\\nwaivers, which are federal permission slips to experiment with the administration\\r\\nof public assistance programs. Such reform efforts require waivers from the federal\\r\\ngovernment because they diverge from the broadly inclusive language of\\r\\n\\r\\nentitlement spelled out in the Social Security Act. Table 1 shows that while some\\r\\nof the earliest states to apply for waivers were historically meager welfare states\\r\\n(Alabama, Georgia) many others were historically progressive and generous welfare\\r\\n\\r\\nstates. Ohio, New Jersey, and Minnesota each were early adopters of new assistance\\r\\ncommitments and have set relatively high benefit levels, and New York, California,\\r\\nand Wisconsin have been national leaders in AFDC and other welfare state\\r\\nprograms. All were among the states submitting waivers in the early 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 625\\r\\n\\r\\nTABLE 1.

Has a new logic\\r\\nof welfare reform emerged at the state-level in the past decade - one being led by\\r\\n\\r\\ndifferent states than the previous wave of reform?\\r\\nIn this article, we use historical and quantitative evidence to model the\\r\\nsubmission of federal waivers in the AFDC program between the years 1989 and\\r\\n\\r\\n1995, the year prior to the enactment of federal legislation that essentially abolished\\r\\n\\r\\nthe AFDC program. We examine the small, newly emergent literature on policy\\r\\nretrenchment (Bowles &amp; Gintis 1982; Myles &amp; Pierson 1997; Pierson 1994, 1996;\\r\\nSoule &amp; Zylan 1997) to develop and test hypotheses about the economic, political,\\r\\nand institutional dimensions of contemporary welfare reform in the states. To\\r\\n\\r\\nforeshadow our results, we find that the submission of federal AFDC waivers was,\\r\\n\\r\\nindeed, led by different states than those that led the earlier wave, and in this case\\r\\nRepublican legislators, not Democrats, led the way. However, while the actors leading\\r\\nstate-level retrenchment may have been different, there are striking similarities\\r\\nbetween the mechanisms driving retrenchment in both cases. We find that\\r\\n\\r\\npartisanship, racial politics and the institutional dimensions of the policy\\r\\nenvironment continue to be crucial factors predicting which states will enact\\r\\nrestrictive reforms in their public assistance programs. Additionally, as was the case\\r\\nin the earlier wave, we find evidence that these reforms diffused from state to state\\r\\n\\r\\nin a systematic fashion. In short, state-level welfare retrenchment in the 1980s and\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c626 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\n1990s has been a story of political interests and institutions, much as it was in the\\r\\n\\r\\n1940s and 1950s.2\\r\\n\\r\\nDeterminants of Policy Retrenchment\\r\\nThe literature on social policy development typically focuses on either the origins\\r\\nof policies or the level of expenditures associated with selected programs. While\\r\\n\\r\\nsome of this research makes mention of welfare \"backlash\" (Borg &amp; Castles 1981;\\r\\nCastles 1982; Wilensky 1975) very few studies have attempted to systematically\\r\\nmodel the determinants of policies of retrenchment. This reflects the impact of\\r\\n\\r\\nthe work of T.H. Marshall (1963), who predicted a steady, progressive accretion of\\r\\ncivil, political, and social rights, through the enactment of policies requiring ever\\r\\ndeeper levels of state intervention. However, as states and nations enter the\\r\\npostindustrial phase of capitalism, and as the geopolitical ground of citizenship\\r\\nclaims appears to be undergoing reexamination (Soysal 1994), welfare\\r\\nretrenchment has become an increasingly salient feature of policy development\\r\\nin the U.S. and Europe. The determinants of welfare retrenchment are, therefore,\\r\\n\\r\\nsimultaneously important to uncover and (as yet) little theorized.\\r\\nThe work of Paul Pierson and colleagues is an exception. Pierson\\'s examination\\r\\n\\r\\nof retrenchment efforts in the United States, Great Britain, Germany and Sweden\\r\\nsuggests that these policy developments are not adequately explained by existing\\r\\n\\r\\ntheories of the welfare state3 (Myles &amp; Pierson 1997; Pierson 1994; Pierson 1996).\\r\\nNor are they captured by a model that inverts or \"mirrors\" standard accounts of\\r\\nexpansion. Instead, Pierson argues that retrenchment efforts must be thought of\\r\\nas a qualitatively new social and political process, the product of a \"new politics of\\r\\nthe welfare state\" (Pierson 1996). In nation-states characterized by extensive welfare\\r\\nstate commitments, he notes, the importance of entrenched interests and programbased political constituencies must be incorporated into any explanation of policy\\r\\nretrenchment. His account therefore stresses the importance of \"critical constraints\\r\\non reform resulting from the role of supportive interest groups and, ultimately,\\r\\n\\r\\nvoters\" (Pierson 1996:144). In other words, the retrenchment of welfare state\\r\\nprograms is difficult and perilous for would-be reformers. The conditions of success\\r\\nhave more to do with the ability of reformers to sidestep public outrage over proposed\\r\\n\\r\\ncuts (itself a function of the policy environment within which reformers operate)\\r\\nthan with the strength or weakness of the left, the autonomy of state actors, or the\\r\\n\\r\\nnature of economic development. While attacks on the poor seem to have been at\\r\\nthe center of retrenchment efforts pursued by conservative governments, Pierson\\r\\nnotes that whether or not a program is means-tested (or otherwise targets the poor)\\r\\n\\r\\nis not the best predictor of its vulnerability to retrenchment. Instead, he claims\\r\\nthat \"retrenchment occurred where supporting interest groups were weak, or where\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 627\\r\\n\\r\\nthe government found ways to prevent the mobilization of these groups\\' supporters\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(Pierson 1994:6).4\\r\\nPierson\\'s claim that there is a new politics of the welfare state is persuasive in\\r\\nlight of his in-depth, comparative analyses of retrenchment in several major policy\\r\\n\\r\\nareas. His empirical research, however, is largely qualitative, and focuses on crossnational comparisons. This approach, while useful in generating rich, detailed\\r\\nnarratives of the processes of retrenchment, may mask broader mechanisms -\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch as institutional processes of diffusion - better captured by quantitative\\r\\nmethods. We seek to understand developments in one program - Aid to Families\\r\\nwith Dependent Children - over time and at the state level, and are thus afforded\\r\\nthe opportunity to use quantitative data to model welfare state retrenchment. In\\r\\n\\r\\nanother sense, we are asking a slightly different question than Pierson and\\r\\ncolleagues (although it is one informed by the model they propose): has state-level\\r\\nretrenchment in the AFDC program occurred as the result of a substantially new\\r\\n\\r\\nform of electoral politics played out on policy-specific playing fields, as Pierson\\'s\\r\\nwork suggests it has? Or has it followed the same logic of institutionally-driven\\r\\nchange as the earlier wave of state-level AFDC reform (Soule &amp; Zylan 1997)?\\r\\nAs part of our investigation of the institutional dimensions of retrenchment,\\r\\nwe directly examine the question of policy diffusion. According to Soule and Zylan\\r\\n(1997) work requirements diffused systematically across states in the middle part\\r\\nof this century. In that particular case, the authors found evidence of cultural\\r\\ndiffusion, but other sorts of linkages may exist between states as well. In recent\\r\\nyears, there has been a dramatic resurgence in interest in the diffusion of various\\r\\nsocial processes (including policy outcomes), spurred, perhaps, by new ways to\\r\\nmodel diffusion (see Strang &amp; Soule 1998). Central to this growing literature is\\r\\nthe idea that information about previous actors\\' actions is utilized by actors\\r\\nattempting to make decisions about how to approach some problem. Under\\r\\nconditions of uncertainty, the careful assessment (and perhaps mimicry) of others\\'\\r\\nactions is a rational strategy for actors to take (Soule 1995).5 Additionally, it seems\\r\\nplausible that certain actors would be more likely to be monitored by actors\\r\\n\\r\\nattempting to make decisions and that other actors would be more likely to \"jump\\r\\non the bandwagon\" once a solution begins to diffuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs diffusion processes were evident in the first round of welfare reform, we\\r\\nexpect they may have operated in this round as well. Below, we generate and test\\r\\nspecific hypotheses derived from the existing literature on welfare state\\r\\nretrenchment and policy diffusion. First, however, we discuss the federal\\r\\n\\r\\nenvironment within which states pursued newly restrictive AFDC programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c628 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Changing Federal Policy Environment and the Submission of Waivers\\r\\nin AFDC\\r\\nAlthough the right of state programs to request federal waivers in order to\\r\\nexperiment with public assistant program characteristics is as old as the A(F)DC\\r\\nprogram itself, it is not surprising that there was a sudden and rapid increase in\\r\\nthe number of waivers submitted during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Beginning\\r\\n\\r\\nwith Ronald Reagan\\'s presidency, the federal government actively encouraged states\\r\\nto depart from business as usual where welfare administration was concerned. In\\r\\nfact, as has been documented elsewhere, the (partly successful) efforts of the Reagan\\r\\nand Bush administrations to cut federal expenditures on public assistance may\\r\\nhave produced more than benign \"encouragement.\" The election of a Democrat\\r\\nin 1992 did not significantly alter this environment, although the public\\r\\n\\r\\ndeclarations by Clinton the candidate and Clinton the President may have\\r\\nsignificantly publicized the receptiveness of the administration to waiver requests\\r\\n\\r\\nby the states. What this added up to was a strong incentive for states to at least\\r\\nconsider the possibility of reforming their AFDC programs.\\r\\nThe first stage of this process began when Ronald Reagan, almost immediately\\r\\n\\r\\nupon assuming the presidency, launched a critique of the American economy that\\r\\nplaced blame on the fact that the government budget was growing faster than the\\r\\nGNP - which he attributed to deficits, over-taxation, loose monetary policy,\\r\\n\\r\\nbureaucratic waste, and misguided welfare handouts (Tobin 1988). Thus, a key\\r\\nfeature of Reaganomics was a plan to curtail non-defense government spending,\\r\\nincluding and especially social welfare programs. He learned (at some political\\r\\ncost) that this was not to be achieved through an assault on social insurance\\r\\n\\r\\nprograms and he soon turned his attention to more politically vulnerable programs,\\r\\nsuch as AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nA central theme of Reagan-era federalism was the devolution of policy\\r\\nimplementation (and much of the funding responsibility) to the state level. Reagan\\r\\nAdministration efforts in the area of AFDC policy were merely one example of\\r\\nthis overall approach to governance. Critics of this approach and its encapsulation\\r\\nin the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 noted that it did little to provide\\r\\nstates freedom to be creative with new public assistance measures; rather it reduced\\r\\nthe share of administrative costs borne by the federal government. Still, it was clear\\r\\nthat a Reagan Era Department of Health and Human Services was likely to be rather\\r\\nmore laissez faire in its supervision of state activities than some of its predecessors,\\r\\nopening up the possibility of state experimentation in Title IV programs.\\r\\nIn the wake of OBRA, a few states began to institute work requirements\\r\\n\\r\\neligibility rules that require recipients to accept available employment or be denied\\r\\nassistance. But state-level reform efforts really exploded in the wake of the federal\\r\\nFamily Support Act of 1988. That Act instituted the Job Opportunities and Basic\\r\\nSkills program, which enabled states to require AFDC recipients to accept\\r\\nemployment or face benefit reductions or other sanctions. Many recipients were\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 629\\r\\n\\r\\ninitially exempted from JOBS and the program did nothing to create the actual\\r\\n\\r\\njobs recipients were intended to fill. But it set in place a structure that states began\\r\\nto build upon in their subsequent efforts to push poor women into private sector\\r\\nemployment and out of the public assistance system.\\r\\nThe election of another Republican president, George Bush, ensured the\\r\\ncontinued receptivity of federal agencies to state requests to experiment with AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the end of his term, Bush (in an increasingly pitched battle with \"New\\r\\nDemocrat\" challenger Bill Clinton) addressed welfare reform explicitly in his 1992\\r\\nState of the Union Address. Bush promised that his administration would make\\r\\nthe waiver process \"quicker and easier for every state that asks our help\" and he\\r\\nmade good on the offer: by July, his administration had approved six demonstration\\r\\nprojects. The arrival of a Democrat at the White House following the 1992 elections\\r\\nchanged little. Clinton made \"ending welfare as we know it\" a cornerstone of the\\r\\ncentrist Democratic agenda, and the swift approval - and even solicitation - of\\r\\nwaiver requests was adopted as a standing practice by his Department of Health\\r\\nand Human Services. Despite dissension within the Democratic Administration\\r\\nover the nature of welfare reform efforts (symbolized most dramatically by the\\r\\nresignation of HHS secretary Mary Jo Bane), the waiver approval process continued\\r\\n\\r\\nat a rapid pace throughout the first term of the Clinton presidency (Bane 1997).6\\r\\nDocuments issued from the Department of Health and Human Services during\\r\\n\\r\\nthis time make it clear that Clinton had encouraged approval of waiver requests\\r\\nand that the Department was working closely with state governors to expedite the\\r\\nprocess of state and local reform (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human\\r\\n\\r\\nServices 1994). Since the approval of waivers was undertaken procedurally and\\r\\nnot legislatively (an interagency council reviewed, approved, and oversaw requests\\r\\nfrom the states), a receptive administration virtually ensured a steady stream of\\r\\n\\r\\napprovals once requests were submitted by interested states.\\r\\nEven as waivers were understood to be state \"experiments,\" they were clearly\\r\\ninformed by federal policy. For example, the most popular reforms that were\\r\\nundertaken as part of state waiver projects after the Family Support Act was passed\\r\\n\\r\\nwere work requirements modeled on the JOBS program.7 The names of some of\\r\\nthese projects are instructive about the discourse of poverty that has come to\\r\\ndominate this phase of AFDC reform: Avenues to Self-Sufficiency Through\\r\\nEmployment and Training Services (ASSETS) in Alabama, Employing and Moving\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople Off Welfare and Encouraging Responsibility (EMPOWER) of Arizona, Work\\r\\nFirst (N. Carolina), and Learning, Earning and Parenting (LEAP) in Ohio (which\\r\\n\\r\\nwas also nicknamed \"Self-Sufficiency Through Tough Love\" by Ohio\\'s Governor\\r\\nGeorge Voinovich). A typical waiver package expanded JOBS participation\\r\\nrequirements and activities, increased sanctions for nonparticipation, and altered\\r\\n\\r\\nthe earned income disregard.8 States also implemented family caps, job training\\r\\nprograms, time limits, improved fraud detection systems, school attendance\\r\\nrequirements, categorical exclusions of some recipients (immigrants, teenage\\r\\n\\r\\nmothers, or mothers bearing children while receiving assistance), and changes in\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c630 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\ntheir transitional child care allowances. In short, waiver projects have sought to\\r\\nlimit eligibility, punish some forms of sexual/reproductive behavior, lower overall\\r\\nbenefits, encourage employment-focused ethics and behavior, and institute farreaching, permanent limits on the growth of the AFDC recipient population\\r\\n(particularly through time limits).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of these reforms were incorporated into the federal legislation that\\r\\nPresident Bill Clinton signed in the late summer of 1996. The Personal\\r\\nResponsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) established\\r\\n\\r\\ntime limits, new work requirements, incentives for state reductions in teen and\\r\\nunwed pregnancy rates, mechanisms for paternity enforcement, rules excluding\\r\\nlegal immigrants from eligibility, and changes in the child care allowances for aid\\r\\nrecipients. The PRWORA also marked a dramatic break with the past by ending\\r\\nthe entitlement status of AFDC.\\r\\nThus what began as an effort to cut federal expenditures on matching funds to\\r\\nstate public assistance programs evolved first into a federal policy encouraging state\\r\\n\\r\\nvariation in administration of those programs. It then evolved into a substantially\\r\\nnew federal policy on income maintenance for poor children and their caretakers.\\r\\nPolicy innovation was informed by, and then informed, federal policy and practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it is clear that Reagan-era policies and their progeny sparked a flurry of\\r\\nwelfare reform activity in the states, the actions of the federal government tell us\\r\\nlittle about which states submitted AFDC waivers and when. The Reagan, Bush,\\r\\nand Clinton Administrations\\' policies encouraged and provoked state autonomy\\r\\nin a universal fashion, yet not every state sought an AFDC waiver, and among those\\r\\n\\r\\nthat did, some acted more quickly than others. Did states act in response to\\r\\ncharacteristics of their AFDC programs that might have been directly or indirectly\\r\\naffected by Reagan-era policies (e.g., high caseloads)? Did \"fend-for-yourself\\r\\n\\r\\nfederalism\" create fiscal crises that drove state actors to look for ways to cut\\r\\nspending - leading them in the direction of the already vulnerable AFDC program?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf so, we would expect states with such crises to have been in the forefront of the\\r\\nreform wave. Alternatively, states may have responded to the uniformly stringent\\r\\n\\r\\n(and enticing) federal environment in varying ways, according to intrastate\\r\\ncharacteristics and/or dynamics linking states to each other. To explain which states\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmitted waivers and when, we examine quantitative data, utilizing diffusion\\r\\nmodels within an event history framework. Below, we outline the model and the\\r\\nhypotheses, then present and discuss our results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model\\r\\nSince we are interested in both inter- and intrastate factors which influenced the\\r\\n\\r\\nsubmission and diffusion of waivers, we use a relatively new diffusion model\\r\\nproposed by Strang and Tuma (1993). The model is conceptualized in an event\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 631\\r\\n\\r\\nhistory framework, making the interpretation of results intuitive for most social\\r\\nscientists.9 The model is particularly useful for our study because we are able to\\r\\ntest for spatial heterogeneity, or the idea that a state\\'s submission of a waiver may\\r\\naffect other states\\' rates of submission more or less depending on their location in\\r\\nthe same region, and depending on how influential the first state is. Additionally,\\r\\nwe are able to examine whether or not certain states are more or less vulnerable to\\r\\nthe diffusion of this type of policy retrenchment. The heterogenous diffusion model\\r\\nproposed by Strang and Tuma (1993) includes four vectors of effects and\\r\\nhypothesizes that the rate of adoption of an innovation (here, a submission of a\\r\\nwaiver) is a multiplicative function of these vectors. The first vector, the propensity\\r\\nvector, includes measures of a states \"intrinsic\" rate of waiver submission, as in a\\r\\ntraditional event history regression model. The second vector, the susceptibility vector,\\r\\n\\r\\nincludes measures of how vulnerable a state is to the actions of other states. The\\r\\nthird vector, the infectiousness vector, includes measures of how influential a state\\r\\nthat has already submitted a waiver is. The fourth vector is the diffusion vector, often\\r\\n\\r\\nreferred to as the proximity vector in the literature. The heterogenous diffusion\\r\\n\\r\\nmodel, described in Strang and Tuma (1993:621), is represented as:\\r\\n\\r\\nrn (t) = exp( aXn + E fVn + EX r\\'Ws + E 8 Zns)\\r\\ns565(t) se5\\'(t) se5\\'(t)\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere n is the state that has not yet submitted a waiver, and s is the state that has\\r\\nalready submitted a waiver. 10 In the model, Xn is the propensity vector, Vn is the\\r\\nsusceptibility vector, Ws is the infectiousness vector, and Zns is the diffusion vector.\\r\\nThe vectors of parameter estimates for each of these are denoted by: a,b,g, and d.\\r\\nThe models presented in this paper were estimated through a set of SAS macros\\r\\nwritten by David Strang (Strang 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurement and Hypotheses\\r\\nThe dependent variable in our analysis is the rate of state waiver submission1\" to\\r\\nthe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The year in which a state\\r\\nsubmitted a waiver was obtained from a chart of waiver activity compiled by the\\r\\nHudson Institute, a policy research center. The Hudson Institute obtained\\r\\n\\r\\ninformation on waiver activity directly from the DHHS. 12 Since reform activities\\r\\nhave been ongoing, data on state-level welfare practices have been in some flux.\\r\\nTherefore, we decided to cross-check the Hudson Institute data against five\\r\\nadditional sources. First, we consulted a 1996 report by the DHHS entitled,\\r\\n\"Selected Provisions of Approved State Welfare Reform Demonstration.\" Second,\\r\\nwe consulted the \"News in the States\" page of a website maintained by the American\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Welfare Association (APWA).13 Third, when available, we checked with\\r\\npublished press releases from the DHHS which outline the provisions of waivers\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c632 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nas they were approved by the federal government. 14 Fourth, we checked websites\\r\\nmaintained by individual states - especially those states that have websites from\\r\\ntheir public assistance agencies. Finally, we called public information personnel\\r\\nfrom each of the states\\' public assistance agencies, asking them to supply us with\\r\\n\\r\\nas much information as they could about the substance of waiver requests and the\\r\\ntiming of submission.\\r\\nThe first waiver was requested in 1989 following the enactment of the Family\\r\\n\\r\\nSupport Act; this is the start of our time period. The last was submitted in 1995. In\\r\\n1996 the Clinton Administration\\'s federal legislation was passed, effectively ending\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Aid to Families with Dependent Children program and fundamentally altering\\r\\nthe federal policy environment. Thus we do not collect data on any waivers\\r\\nsubmitted in 1996, as we expect states submitting waivers in that year to have been\\r\\n\\r\\nattempting to conform to the impending federal policy. As Table 1 indicates,\\r\\nbetween 1989 and 1995, 40 states submitted waivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the independent variables used in our analysis come from a variety of\\r\\nwidely available U.S. Government Sources (See Appendix A). Since many of these\\r\\n\\r\\ndata were not available yearly, we use linear interpolation to estimate betweenyear values for our measures. These independent variables are divided into four\\r\\ndifferent categories corresponding to the four different vectors of the model\\r\\n\\r\\ndiscussed above: Propensity, Susceptibility, Infectiousness, and Diffusion.15\\r\\nTHE PROPENSITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nThe propensity vector indicates the intrinsic characteristics of states that are\\r\\n\\r\\nexpected to affect the rate of submission of waivers. The measures in this vector\\r\\nare best thought of as one would think of covariates in a traditional event history\\r\\nmodel. We break the analysis down according to the logic of causality. Broad\\r\\n\\r\\nsocioeconomic factors should be causally prior to medium-term political\\r\\nconfigurations, which should be causally prior to short-term institutional\\r\\ncharacteristics in shaping states\\' actions toward waiver submission.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the work of Soule and Zylan (1997), we first examine the effect of\\r\\neconomic development on submission. According to the \"logic of industrialism\"\\r\\nthesis of welfare state development, welfare states expand along with industrial\\r\\ndevelopment (Cutright 1965; Wilensky 1975). If it was the logic of welfare states\\r\\nto expand with industrialism, perhaps it is the logic of advanced welfare states to\\r\\npare back as industrial economies evolve into service-based economies. To examine\\r\\n\\r\\nthis hypothesis, in our models we include a measure of service sector receipts as a\\r\\npercentage of the gross state product. If there is a \"logic of postindustrialism\" driving\\r\\n\\r\\nretrenchment, we would expect this measure to increase the rate of waiver activity.\\r\\nAdditionally, we include in our analysis three measures indicating the\\r\\n\\r\\nsociopolitical dimensions of policy making in the states: the percentage of the state\\r\\npopulation that is black, the level of immigration to the state, and the rate of births\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 633\\r\\n\\r\\nto unmarried mothers. During the earlier wave of retrenchment, racially-defined\\r\\nsystems of political access structured the enactment of work requirements. We\\r\\nexpect that the percentage of the population which is black and the immigration\\r\\nrate should increase the rate of waiver submission. These measures tap into the\\r\\nracial dimensions of the program, testing the claims of Quadagno (1990), Lieberman\\r\\n(1995) and others that racial inequality and conflict have structured welfare state\\r\\ndevelopment in the United States, particularly in the system of public assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nRacialized policy discourses have long plagued the AFDC program (Bell 1965; Soule\\r\\n&amp; Zylan 1997); where a greater share of the population is black, racial conflict may\\r\\nbe exacerbated, and AFDC may become a site of racial politicking.\\r\\nThis consideration of race-based political processes raises a more general point\\r\\nabout how political conflicts may affect policymakers\\' actions. One important\\r\\nperspective on policy development emphasizes the processes of democratic\\r\\nresponsiveness (Page &amp; Shapiro 1983) and dynamic representation (Stimson et al\\r\\n1995). These two principles hold that government policies are responsive to citizen\\r\\n\\r\\npreferences as expressed though public opinion (Page &amp; Shapiro 1983). For\\r\\nexample, we might expect that public opposition to welfare spending drives state\\r\\nand federal welfare retrenchment. When we examine the General Social Survey\\r\\nfor the years in which data on opposition to federal welfare spending is available\\r\\n\\r\\n(1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994) it appears that there might be a relationship between\\r\\nnational-level opposition to federal welfare spending and the number of state-\\r\\n\\r\\nwaivers submitted (see the GSS website http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/gss/trend).\\r\\nHowever, note that the public opinion data from the GSS are not available for 1992,\\r\\n\\r\\na critical year in this phase of welfare retrenchment. More importantly, for our\\r\\nanalysis, public opinion data on relevant questions simply does not exist. In order\\r\\n\\r\\nto examine the arguments advanced by democratic responsiveness theorists, we\\r\\nwould need state-level public opinion data, measured yearly, to adequately test these\\r\\n\\r\\nhypotheses in our study; unfortunately this data is not available. 16\\r\\nOne measure that may indirectly capture democratic responsiveness is a\\r\\n\\r\\nmeasure of immigration in the state. The issue of immigration - legal and\\r\\nnonlegal - has been politicized, racialized, and linked to welfare policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)\\r\\nmaintain websites full of information about why the U.S. should restrict\\r\\nimmigration; one pervasive argument for immigration restriction is that\\r\\nimmigrants are disproportionate users of public assistance. 17 Clearly, this argument\\r\\nmade sense to Congressional welfare reformers, who explicitly restricted immigrants\\'\\r\\nuse of public assistance with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities\\r\\nReconciliation Act. Additionally, in 1995, 56% of people polled favored cutting\\r\\n\\r\\noff public assistance to immigrants who have been in the U.S. for fewer than five\\r\\nyears (Gallup 1995). We hypothesize that states with high levels of immigration\\r\\nwill have higher rates of waiver submission as they attempt to constrict AFDC. As\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c634 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\na measure of states\\' immigration levels, we use the percentage of immigrants\\r\\nadmitted to the U.S. by the intended state of residence.\\r\\nPolicy officials and the public have long expressed concern about the rising\\r\\nincidence of unmarried motherhood, sometimes arguing that welfare benefits\\r\\n\\r\\nencourage women to bear children out of wedlock (Bell 1965; Soule &amp; Zylan 1997).\\r\\nWhere the rate of nonmarital births is high, policy-makers might be more inclined\\r\\n\\r\\nto experiment with policy reforms (such as family caps or categorical exclusions)\\r\\ncommon to the waivers submitted during this period. We use the ratio of births to\\r\\nunmarried women per 1,000 live births (Ventura 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the models presented below, we add to this first block of variables several\\r\\nmeasures indicating the left/right balance of political power. Soule and Zylan (1997)\\r\\nfound that partisanship mattered during the first wave of reform, as non-Southern\\r\\nDemocratic legislators led the enactment of work requirements. We expect party\\r\\naffiliation to again be important, but we hypothesize that Republican-controlled\\r\\nstates were more likely to favor the submission of waivers. While Republicans were\\r\\nnot the only advocates of welfare reform (as our previous discussion of the federal\\r\\npolicy environment suggests), the historical evidence suggests that they may have\\r\\n\\r\\nbeen the leaders of such efforts. Thus we have constructed a single dummy variable\\r\\ncoded one if the state\\'s legislature is controlled by the Republican Party (a majority).\\r\\nNoting the importance of governors in the recent wave of reform (Teles 1996), we\\r\\nalso include a dummy variable for whether or not the state\\'s governor is a\\r\\nRepublican.\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard accounts of welfare state development have emphasized the role of\\r\\nworking class mobilization in the expansion of systems of provision, and one\\r\\naccount of retrenchment offered by Bowles and Gintis (1982) suggests this effect\\r\\nmay be producing a kind of backlash from capital in advanced welfare states.\\r\\nAccording to Bowles and Gintis, it is the very success of labor in securing basic\\r\\n\\r\\nprotections against labor market uncertainty that has produced a dilemma for\\r\\ncapital as it faces new accumulation crises. Thus, the attack on the welfare state\\r\\nmay be capital\\'s attempt to reestablish the terms of labor\\'s exploitation (Bowles &amp;\\r\\nGintis 1982: 91). We hypothesize that retrenchment efforts would therefore be most\\r\\naggressive where labor is strong. We include a measure of union density - the\\r\\nproportion of the nonagricultural labor force organized in unions - to examine\\r\\nthis hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the models presented below, we also include a block of variables that measure\\r\\nelements of the policy environment. First, we directly test the hypothesis that current\\r\\n\\r\\nreform states are not the same states that led the earlier wave of reform by including\\r\\n\\r\\na dummy variable indicating whether or not the state passed a work requirement\\r\\nbetween 1950 and 1967 (Soule &amp; Zylan 1997). Next, we examine the extent to\\r\\nwhich a high per capita AFDC caseload and high AFDC payments drove states to\\r\\nlook for ways to retrench their programs. We hypothesize that states with high AFDC\\r\\n\\r\\ncaseloads should have higher rates of waiver submission, as these states might be\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 635\\r\\n\\r\\nespecially interested in reducing coverage. High caseloads were shown by Soule\\r\\nand Zylan (1997) to positively influence states to adopt work requirements during\\r\\n\\r\\nthe earlier phase of reform. We use the per capita transformation of the number of\\r\\n\\r\\nAFDC cases to control for differences in state population. We also indude a measure\\r\\nof the average AFDC payment in the state. In a period of federal de-funding, states\\r\\nwith high benefits might have sought waivers as a form of state-based problem\\r\\n\\r\\nsolving or \"puzzling\" (Heclo 1974), seeking to reduce overall expenditures on the\\r\\nprogram by reducing caseloads rather than benefits. Such states may have viewed\\r\\nthe submission of AFDC waivers as a way to retain high quality programs of\\r\\nassistance in an environment of growing budgetary austerity.\\r\\nOther aspects of the policy environment constitute the heart of the \"new\\r\\n\\r\\npolitics\" model proffered by Pierson and colleagues. Thus, our analysis includes a\\r\\nnumber of measures designed to indicate the political dimensions of policy legacies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we examine Pierson\\'s claim that high levels of visible taxation may produce\\r\\nprogram vulnerability and therefore enhance retrenchment efforts (Pierson 1994).\\r\\nIf this is true, we would expect to see a positive relationship between state-level\\r\\nincome taxation and waiver activity. As tax revenues are extremely variable, we\\r\\n\\r\\nexpect trends in taxation to be more important to retrenchment politics than their\\r\\nlevel in any given year. Thus, we include a measure of the change in state income\\r\\ntax receipts per capita, taking the change over the three years prior to the year of\\r\\nobservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext we examine Pierson\\'s claim that aspects of the policy environment create\\r\\npolitical constraints on the enactment of potential reforms. Specifically, he argues\\r\\nthat preexisting policies produce political constituencies of their own. Members\\r\\nof the voting public are often recipients of the benefits provided by state policies.\\r\\nEven as there may be a generalized public distaste for \"welfare,\" the public is\\r\\nunlikely to welcome cuts in the programs they enjoy. A program can become more\\r\\nvulnerable than others in a time of political conservatism if its beneficiaries are\\r\\nnot well mobilized, not particularly plentiful, or not aligned with the beneficiaries\\r\\n\\r\\nof another, more protected program. The recipients of AFDC have, with the\\r\\nexception of one brief period at the end of the 1960s, never been well-mobilized\\r\\nin their own defense. Thus we need to look at the constituents of collateral policies\\r\\nto understand the context of policy-related interests within which AFDC reform\\r\\nwas undertaken. As the above discussion of Reagan\\'s retrenchment efforts at the\\r\\nfederal level suggests, the resistance of Social Security recipients could waylay\\r\\n\\r\\nattempts to make cuts in that program, leading reformers to look elsewhere for\\r\\nretrenchment targets. Pierson notes that unemployment benefits and AFDC\\r\\n\\r\\nspending were particularly vulnerable in this sense, as they were decentralized and\\r\\ncould fall victim to the forces of interstate competition (Pierson 1994: 101).

We anticipate, therefore, that the fate of AFDC may have been\\r\\n\\r\\ndirectly tied to the fate of Unemployment Insurance and inversely related to the\\r\\nstrength of Social Security in the state. We include measures of the number of\\r\\n\\r\\nrecipients in each program, controlled for the state population.\\r\\nTHE SUSCEPTIBILITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning from intrastate to interstate mechanisms of retrenchment, we next\\r\\nconsider the possibility that some states are more susceptible to the diffusion of\\r\\n\\r\\npolicy innovations than other states. Discerning whether or not a characteristic of\\r\\na state increases its rate of submission of a waiver or increases its susceptibility to\\r\\nthe diffusion waivers (or both) is not always immediately obvious or intuitive. Many\\r\\nof the measures described in the previous section (propensity effects) might also\\r\\naffect a state\\'s susceptibility to the diffusion of waivers. Since in the diffusion model\\r\\n\\r\\ndescribed above, a variable can have an effect in multiple vectors, \"final model\\r\\nspecification should be preceded by exploratory analysis that includes variables in\\r\\nboth propensity and susceptibility vectors\" (Davis &amp; Greve 1997:20). The models\\r\\npresented below reflect the final specifications after extensive exploratory analysis.18\\r\\n\\r\\nWe suspect that the susceptibility of a state to a diffusing innovation such as\\r\\nthe submission of waivers may have been affected by the fiscal concerns of the\\r\\nstate. Many states faced fiscal crises during the early 1990s as a result of the\\r\\nrecession, high spending during the eighties, and the federalist practices of the\\r\\n\\r\\nReagan and Bush administrations (Gold 1995; Pierson 1994). We hypothesize that\\r\\nstates facing severe fiscal imbalances may have sought ways to cut back on\\r\\n\\r\\nexpenditures (O\\'Connor 1973; Offe 1984). AFDC waivers were designed to do just\\r\\nthat and may have seemed an attractive policy option to financially ailing states.\\r\\nWe expect that there may have been a threshold effect whereby states facing extreme\\r\\n\\r\\nfiscal crises were more vulnerable to \"catchy\" policy innovations pursued by other\\r\\nstates. To measure this, we have constructed a dummy variable coded one if the\\r\\nstate is facing one of the ten most severe fiscal imbalances, and zero if it is not one\\r\\n\\r\\nof these top ten.19 To measure fiscal crisis, we subtract the total state expenditures\\r\\nfrom the total state revenues and divide this figure by the state revenues.\\r\\nTHE INFECTIOUSNESS VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nIf some states are particularly susceptible to diffusion, others may be especially\\r\\ninfluential in the spread of new policies. One of the distinct advantages of the model\\r\\nused in this paper is its ability to specify which states\\' actions mean the most to the\\r\\n\\r\\ndecisions of other states. Davis and Greve (1997) describe the process by which\\r\\ncertain referents are chosen by individual organizations. We seek to do the same\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c638 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nhere. We ask, much like these authors did for organizations, which states are more\\r\\nlikely to legitimate this particular form of social policy.\\r\\nWe hypothesize that states that are known as traditional innovators are more\\r\\ninfluential to this process than are other states. States that are thought of historically\\r\\nas innovators are more likely to be watched, in a sense, and copied by others. Robert\\r\\nEyestone (1977) suggests that there may be what he terms a \"segmented emulation\\r\\nprocess\" of innovation (Eyestone 1977: 442). A given policy must first be adopted\\r\\n\\r\\nby recognized leader states (or those that have historically or traditionally been\\r\\ninnovative with regard to different policies), then it is adopted as a consequence of\\r\\n\\r\\ndiffusion from leader to follower states (Eyestone 1977: 442).2o Hence we expect\\r\\nthat a waiver submission by one of the most innovative states ought to increase the\\r\\nrate of submission for all other states. To measure this, we use Walker\\'s (1969)\\r\\ninnovation score.21\\r\\nTHE DIFFUSION VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nAs noted earlier, one of the most common findings in diffusion research is that\\r\\nactors that are dose to one another tend to influence one another. Strang and Soule\\r\\n(1998) note that geographic proximity is likely to increase interaction and that\\r\\n\\r\\ngeographically proximal actors are likely to be the most aware of one another.\\r\\nAdditionally, the policy innovation literature is rife with references to the regional\\r\\ndiffusion of policies (See Berry 1994 for a review). Simply put, the regional diffusion\\r\\nargument posits that the probability of a state enacting a certain policy is increased\\r\\nwhen states within the same region have already enacted it. We use the U.S. Bureau\\r\\nof the Census-defined regions in oar analysis in an attempt to ascertain whether\\r\\nor not the submission of waivers diffused within geographic region.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults and Discussion\\r\\nTHE PROPENSITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nTable 2 summarizes the results of models designed to ascertain which intrinsic\\r\\n\\r\\ncharacteristics of states lead to higher rates of waiver request submission. In the\\r\\nlanguage of Soule and Zylan (1997) and Berry (1994), these are the \"intrastate\"\\r\\neffects. These models test hypotheses derived from recent studies of welfare\\r\\nretrenchment by Pierson and colleagues (Myles &amp; Pierson 1997; Pierson 1995;\\r\\n1996) and by Soule and Zylan (1997).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the socioeconomic and demographic variables we include in\\r\\nthe analysis, we first note the positive coefficient on our measure of the service\\r\\nsector. This coefficient is significant in the first two of the three models, suggesting\\r\\n\\r\\nthat there is indeed a \"logic of postindustrialism\" driving retrenching reforms. If\\r\\nwe interpret the coefficient on this measure in Model 1, for example, we find that\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 639\\r\\n\\r\\nan increase from the mean value of this variable to the maximum value of this\\r\\nvariable yields an increase in the multiplier on the rate of waiver submission from\\r\\n\\r\\n1.6 to 4.4. It should be noted, however, that this effect washes out with the inclusion\\r\\nof policy environment variables in Model 3 of Table 2, which suggests that the\\r\\nevolution of the economy may be important only to the extent that it produces\\r\\nextensive welfare state commitments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find similar results for the coefficient on immigration.22 While high\\r\\nimmigration levels do positively affect waiver submission as we hypothesized\\r\\n(models 1 and 2), this effect appears to be mediated by the policy environment in\\r\\n\\r\\nthe state (model 3). It, like our measure of the service sector, loses significance\\r\\nwhen we include the policy environment variables. This is true, as well, of our\\r\\nmeasure of the nonmarital birth rate. Surprisingly, this coefficient is negative in\\r\\n\\r\\nall three models, suggesting that, contrary to the rhetoric surrounding AFDC, states\\r\\nwith relatively low levels of unmarried motherhood were fastest to submit waivers.\\r\\nThe magnitude of this effect is small, but the direction of the relationship remains\\r\\n\\r\\nconsistent across the models.23\\r\\nIn Table 2 we also find a strong, positive, and significant effect of the racial\\r\\ncomposition of the population. Specifically, states with relatively large black\\r\\npopulations were fastest to submit waivers.24 The effect of this variable holds across\\r\\n\\r\\nall models, indicating that racial dynamics were a significant factor in the\\r\\nretrenchment process. The magnitude of the coefficient of this measure is also quite\\r\\n\\r\\nhigh. In model 3, it is 8.24, for example. This means that increasing the black\\r\\npopulation from 10% to 50% increases the multiplier on the rate of waiver\\r\\nsubmission from 2.3 to 61.5, an enormous increase. This finding echoes that of\\r\\nSoule and Zylan (1997) for the earlier wave of AFDC reform. While a democratic\\r\\nresponsiveness interpretation of the immigration and racial composition of the\\r\\n\\r\\npopulation seems eminently plausible - that is, where immigration is high and\\r\\nthe relative percentage of African Americans is high, welfare \"backlash\" results\\r\\nas we noted in an earlier footnote, our direct measure of ideological orientation\\r\\n\\r\\nwas not significant in any of our models (results not shown). It did, however,\\r\\noperate in the predicted direction. Thus, we are unable to rule out the possibility\\r\\nthat public opinion is at least partially driving waiver submission.\\r\\nTurning now to political-institutional characteristics of states, in model 2 of\\r\\nTable 2 we add measures of the composition of the state legislature, the partisanship\\r\\nof the governor, and the density of union membership in the state. The coefficients\\r\\non the Republican legislature and Republican governor measures are both positive\\r\\nand significant. If parties to the left of the political spectrum have been most\\r\\n\\r\\ninfluential in promoting the initiation and expansion of programs of social\\r\\nprovision (Amenta &amp; Poulsen 1996; Esping-Andersen 1985, 1990; Korpi 1980),\\r\\n\\r\\nthen policies contracting social provision may reasonably be expected to emerge\\r\\nfrom the right of the political spectrum. Here we find evidence that they have.25\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c640 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\nTABLE 3: Diffusion of Waiver Submission, 1989-1995\\r\\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\\r\\nPropensity oX\\r\\nIntercept -6.31*** -6.11*** -6.35*** -6.30***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.67) (.79) (.65) (.64)\\r\\nPercentblackpopulation 7.88*** 4.71*** 8.21*** 4.96***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.96) (.91) (.98) (.92)\\r\\nPercent Republican legislators 1.83*** 1.84*** 1.97*** 1.80***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.50) (.47) (.49) (.49)\\r\\nRepublican governor .62*** .44*** .59*** .35**\\r\\n(.13) (.12) (.13) (.12)\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion density .01** .02** .01* .02*\\r\\n(.005) (.005) (.005) (.007)\\r\\n\\r\\nWork requirement passed -.40** -.44** -.34** -.50***\\r\\n(1950-67)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.13)\\r\\n\\r\\nAverageAFDC payments 31.99*** 25.58*** 36.59*** 28.48***\\r\\n\\r\\n(4.69) (4.58) (4.82) (4.73)\\r\\nAFDC recipients per capita 3.29** 4.40*** 3.27*** 4.37***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.89) (.89) (.89) (.89)\\r\\nChange in state taxes (3 years) 4.23*** 3.75*** 4.40*** 4.02***\\r\\n(1.22) (1.28) (1.23) (1.30)\\r\\nUnemploy. insur. recip.\\r\\nper capita -54.56*** -42.04*** -57.53*** -42.32***\\r\\n\\r\\n(7.96) (7.97) (7.94) (7.99)\\r\\nSoc. sec. recipients per capita 10.73*** 7.12*** 9.45** 6.91*\\r\\n\\r\\n(3.68) (3.47) (3.62) (3.42)\\r\\nSusceptibility *\\r\\nIntercept .01*** .01*** .01*** .01***\\r\\n\\r\\n(.001) (.001) (.001) (.001)\\r\\n\\r\\nFiscal\\r\\n\\r\\ncrisis\\r\\n\\r\\n.005***\\r\\n(.0002)\\r\\n\\r\\n.01***\\r\\n(.0005)\\r\\n\\r\\nInfectiousness y\\r\\n\\r\\nWalker innovation score .60*** .60***\\r\\n(.04)\\r\\n\\r\\n(.04)\\r\\n\\r\\nDiffusion 8\\r\\n\\r\\nGeographic\\r\\n\\r\\n.02***\\r\\n\\r\\n.01**\\r\\n(.003) (.004)\\r\\n\\r\\nLikelihood ratio 2 VS.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstant Rate Model 586.01 886.23 600.03 896.01\\r\\ndf\\r\\n\\r\\n13\\r\\n\\r\\n13\\r\\n\\r\\n13\\r\\n\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\nNote.

This finding\\r\\nlends support to Bowles and Gintis\\'s (1982) claim that an attack on welfare may\\r\\nbe, in part, capital\\'s backlash against the traditional working class mobilization in\\r\\n\\r\\nsupport of welfare expansion.\\r\\nIn model 3 we include indicators of the policy environment within which\\r\\n\\r\\nwaivers were considered. Not surprisingly, states with heavy caseloads were quick\\r\\nto submit waivers designed to dramatically contract the scope of the AFDC program.\\r\\nThe coefficient on AFDC recipients is positive and significant. If we interpret this\\r\\ncoefficient, we find that the multiplier on the mean value of our measure of AFDC\\r\\nrecipients is 1.23, but at the maximum value it is 6.66. Thus, the multiplier increases\\r\\nby almost six-fold when we move from the mean to the maximum number of\\r\\nAFDC recipients per capita (based on the coefficient in model 3).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe a similar relationship between benefit levels and waiver submission:\\r\\nstates that offered higher AFDC payments were also in the forefront of waiver\\r\\nsubmission. The magnitude of this coefficient is again quite large. In Model 3, for\\r\\nexample, increasing the benefits from the mean value to the maximum value yields\\r\\nan increase in the multiplier on the rate of submission from 7.7 to 44.6.\\r\\nAdditionally, states that had submitted a work requirement in the 1950s had\\r\\nslower rates of waiver submission, indicating that in fact the states submitting\\r\\nwaivers were different states than those that passed work requirements in the earlier\\r\\nwave of retrenchment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in model 3 of Table 2, we examine trends in state income taxation and\\r\\nwaiver submission; we find the coefficient on this measure to be positive and\\r\\nsignificant. Highly visible taxation may have led to a welfare backlash in some states,\\r\\n\\r\\na finding that supports one dimension of Pierson\\'s new politics model. As\\r\\nmentioned earlier, Pierson\\'s model also stresses the importance of program-based\\r\\nconstituencies over traditional social deavages in welfare retrenchment. In model 3,\\r\\nwe find very strong support for Pierson\\'s contention that welfare state programs\\r\\n\\r\\ncreate electoral constituencies that shape the political calculus governing\\r\\nretrenchment. The number of Unemployment Insurance recipients is negatively\\r\\nand significantly related to waiver submission, while the coefficient on our measure\\r\\nof Social Security recipients is positive and significant.26 As predicted, we find that\\r\\nAFDC programs were protected in states with extensive Unemployment Insurance\\r\\nprograms and were made vulnerable in states with extensive Social Security\\r\\n\\r\\nprograms. Pierson\\'s claim that retrenchment is structured by the political\\r\\nconsequences of program participation is persuasive given these findings. If we\\r\\ninterpret the coefficients on these two measures in model 3, we find that an increase\\r\\nfrom the minimum value of Unemployment Insurance recipients per capita to\\r\\n\\r\\nthe maximum value, means a 21-fold decrease in the multiplier on the rate of\\r\\nwaiver submission (the multiplier decreases from .85 at the minimum to .04 at\\r\\nthe maximum). With respect to Social Security recipients, if we increase from the\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c642 I Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nmean number of recipients per capita to the maximum number, the multiplier\\r\\nincreases from 5.81 to 10.44, or almost doubles.\\r\\nWhen taken together, the results presented in Table 2 indicate that the processes\\r\\n\\r\\nspurring the most recent wave of welfare retrenchment bear strong similarities to\\r\\n\\r\\nthe processes driving the earlier wave of reform. Racial dynamics, 27 partisanship,\\r\\nand the policy environment were again important in predicting which states would\\r\\nsubmit waivers. Yet the states leading the recent reform wave were not the same\\r\\nstates that had led the earlier wave; there is a significant, negative coefficient on the\\r\\nmeasure indicating whether the state had passed a work requirement during the\\r\\nfirst wave. We also find that Republicans replaced Democrats as the party members\\r\\nleading retrenchment efforts in the states.28 Nonetheless, even as these change agents\\r\\nwere not the same, the essential political and institutional mechanisms driving\\r\\nretrenchment have changed little since the late 1950s and early 1960s.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetrenchment in Aid to Families with Dependent Children remains a process\\r\\nundertaken in a context of heavy program demands, racial conflict, and partisan\\r\\npolitics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the results in Table 2 demonstrate the continued importance of\\r\\noverall social policy environments in structuring retrenchment. We find\\r\\nparticularly strong support for Pierson\\'s contention that preexisting policies create\\r\\n\\r\\na treacherous political playing field for would-be reformers. An increasing tax\\r\\nrevenue base may create a public demand for relief in the form of broad-based\\r\\nwelfare reform, but specific cuts are more perilously negotiated by elected officials.\\r\\nSocial policies produce potential defenders as well as critics; defenders come in\\r\\nthe guise of those who enjoy program-based benefits.\\r\\nTHE SUSCEPTIBILITY VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving examined the intrastate mechanisms of retrenchment, we now add\\r\\nmeasures to test for the effects of interstate diffusion. Table 3 presents results of\\r\\nmodels in which we have added the susceptibility, infectiousness and diffusion\\r\\nvectors to a pared-down propensity vector shown in Table 2. In particular, we remove\\r\\n\\r\\nthe three measures that lose significance in model 3 of Table 2, immigration levels,\\r\\nservice sector, and birth rate to unmarried women.29\\r\\nAll of the propensity indicators operate as they did in model 3 of Table 2. In\\r\\nmodel 1, we add to the propensity vector a measure of susceptibility: the extent to\\r\\nwhich the state is experiencing fiscal crisis. Did fiscal crisis make a state more\\r\\n\\r\\nsusceptible to the idea of waivers once they had begun to diffuse? Our findings\\r\\nindicate that it did; the coefficient on the fiscal crisis measure is positive and\\r\\nsignificant. This measure is categorical in nature; the ten states with the most severe\\r\\n\\r\\nimbalances between expenditures and revenues are coded 1, while all other states\\r\\nare coded 0. Therefore, this finding suggests a threshold effect: at relatively severe\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 643\\r\\n\\r\\nlevels of fiscal crisis, states were more susceptible to the diffusion of policies of\\r\\nretrenchment.\\r\\nTHE INFECTIOUSNESS VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nIn model 2, we examine whether or not some states were more likely to serve as\\r\\nreferents to other states. We find that this was indeed the case; innovative states\\r\\n\\r\\nwere more influential actors and their actions were likely to be followed by others.\\r\\nThis lends support to the argument of Eyestone (1977) that the actions of traditional\\r\\n\\r\\ninnovators are likely to be considered legitimate, and that follower states are likely\\r\\nto follow their lead regardless of the nature of the innovation in question. By\\r\\nfollowing innovators, states bolster a different dimension of legitimacy: that which\\r\\n\\r\\nis derived from enacting their roles as followers, pragmatists, or laggards.30\\r\\nTHE DIFFUSION VECTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, in model 3 of Table 3, we include a measure designed to capture any\\r\\nregional diffusion effects: the U.S. Bureau of the Census-defined region in which a\\r\\nstate is located. We find evidence for regional diffusion: the submission of a waiver\\r\\n\\r\\ndiffused across states that are geographically proximate. This lends support to the\\r\\nidea that actors in geographically proximate states are more likely to communicate,\\r\\nor at least to be aware of one another\\'s actions (Strang &amp; Soule 1998).31\\r\\nModel 4 of Table 3 includes all three diffusion vectors along with the propensity\\r\\n\\r\\nvector, providing a final, synthetic model of retrenchment in AFDC. The model\\r\\nindicates that political and institutional factors were most important in determining\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich states would be fastest to submit waivers. The policy environment emerges\\r\\nas a crucial feature of the retrenchment process, as do measures testing Pierson\\'s\\r\\nmodel. Finally, we find evidence of all three aspects of the diffusion process: states\\r\\nexperiencing fiscal crisis are more susceptible to the diffusion of waivers, there is\\r\\ngeographic diffusion of waivers, and traditional innovators are more infectious to\\r\\nthe diffusion process.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nAid to Families with Dependent Children has been a politically contentious\\r\\nprogram of social provision since the early 1950s, when states initiated the first\\r\\nmajor effort to reform the program and trim state responsibilities toward poor\\r\\nwomen and children through the enactment of punitive, restrictive eligibility\\r\\nrequirements. A similar reform wave emerged in the late 1980s, as states again\\r\\nsought to contract social provision by enacting dramatic revisions in their AFDC\\r\\nprograms. However, even as the content of the reforms passed during the first wave\\r\\n\\r\\nwas similar to the content of the reforms passed during the second wave, different\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c644 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nstates and a different party were in the forefront of policy innovation during each\\r\\nwave. While this suggests - on its face - a \"new politics of the welfare state\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe find that the mechanisms driving retrenchment remain fundamentally the\\r\\nsame: partisan politics, racial conflict, and rapid diffusion of the reforms once they\\r\\nbegin to be pursued. Perhaps, as well, some of the impetus for change in the AFDC\\r\\nprogram emerged from shifts in public opinion that made the program particularly\\r\\nsalient as a target for cuts. Certainly the racialized discourse of welfare and welfare\\r\\nreform cannot be ignored as elements of the state retrenchment story.\\r\\nYet all of these mechanisms have operated in the context of particular policy\\r\\nenvironments, and in this sense Pierson and colleagues are correct that there are\\r\\n\\r\\nsome important new institutional elements that must be accounted for in any\\r\\ndiscussion of contemporary welfare politics. In effect, the pressure to reform seems\\r\\nto have come from above and below. The characteristics of the AFDC program itself\\r\\nhave been paramount: states that were facing high benefit levels and/or high recipient\\r\\nrates were fastest to submit waivers designed to radically contract the scope of AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find that institutional characteristics and political dynamics were tightly\\r\\nconnected in retrenchment processes. The configuration of program-derived\\r\\n\\r\\npolitical interests clearly structured the submission of waivers. In the face of\\r\\nextensive citizen participation in the Social Security program, reformers set their\\r\\nsights on the vulnerable public assistance system. Extensive participation in\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment Insurance, on the other hand, could help shield AFDC from the\\r\\ngathering storm of welfare \"backlash\" - itself, in part, a product of increasingly\\r\\nvisible taxation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the \"new politics\" model a dramatic departure from existing theories of the\\r\\nstate and social policy development - or can it be reconciled with those theories?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe suggest the latter conclusion. For one thing, we find echoes of the political/\\r\\ninstitutional account of Pierson and colleagues in the political/institutional account\\r\\nof welfare state expansion offered by some state-centered scholars (Amenta &amp;\\r\\nPoulsen 1996; Amenta, Carruthers &amp; Zylan 1992; Cauthen &amp; Amenta 1996). At\\r\\nthe heart of that account is the intersection of political dynamics (including partisan\\r\\n\\r\\nadvocacy) and the structure of state institutions (induding the shape of preexisting\\r\\npolicy commitments, experiences, and frameworks). Once a simple \"mirror\\r\\nimage\" assumption is dispensed with, we find that the \"new politics\" and\\r\\n\\r\\n\"institutional politics\" theories have much in common.\\r\\nSecond, our analysis suggests the continued relevance of the literature on the\\r\\ndiffusion of innovations. Even as the content of innovation was in this case the\\r\\n\\r\\ncontraction of social provision rather than its expansion, we find striking\\r\\nsimilarities between the diffusion processes characterizing retrenchment and those\\r\\nthat have been identified in studies of expansion. In particular, we find that\\r\\ninnovativeness remains a salient feature of states that structures the diffusion of\\r\\n\\r\\npolicies. States tend to look toward the most innovative states whether they are\\r\\nadopting expansive or restrictive policies. Geographic proximity also operates to\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 645\\r\\n\\r\\nfoster diffusion, and this echoes the findings of previous researchers. Finally, we\\r\\nfind that, as predicted by the literature on innovations, some actors are more\\r\\n\\r\\nsusceptible to the diffusion of new policy instruments than others.\\r\\nIn sum, we suggest that contemporary developments in welfare state politics\\r\\n\\r\\nand policy may be viewed as a continuation of, rather than a radical departure\\r\\nfrom, the history of welfare state politics and policy in the United States and\\r\\n\\r\\nelsewhere. At the very least, recent efforts to \"end welfare as we know it\" have a\\r\\ndecidedly familiar ring to them. While Republicans have had greater success than\\r\\ntheir post-World War II Democratic counterparts in translating their reforms into\\r\\n\\r\\ndecisive national action, they cannot lay claim to originality in their efforts. The\\r\\nnames have changed, but the story remains very much the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\n1. During the first phase of reform, work was required by the institution of a new\\r\\neligibility rule in many states; attempts were made to exclude never married mothers\\r\\nand \"illegitimate\" children. Additionally, existing \"suitable home\" and \"substitute parent\"\\r\\nrules - which provided for the cessation of benefits if a home was deemed unsuitable\\r\\nfor the children, or if a man was discovered in the home of a recipient mother - were\\r\\nmore aggressively enforced through the creation of investigative units which practiced\\r\\n\\r\\nsurveillance of recipients. During the most recent phase of reform, work requirements\\r\\nhave been beefed up through the implementation of time limits and new, tighter\\r\\nexemption rules; teenage parents and recipients who bear children while receiving\\r\\nassistance have been the targets of categorical exclusion. Additionally, new mechanisms\\r\\n\\r\\nenforcing paternity identification and support have been widely implemented.\\r\\n2. One important difference between the two phases of reform is worth mentioning\\r\\nearly in the analysis. During the first wave, states were operating in the absence of federal\\r\\nguidelines about the kinds of changes they might be able to make in their programs\\r\\nwithout incurring federal penalties. Recall that the programs themselves had been\\r\\noperating for a mere ten years in most states, fewer than ten in other states. The Social\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity Board maintained a hands-off policy during the early years of the program\\'s\\r\\nexistence, recognizing the limitations of its power, which was all stick and no carrot.\\r\\n(A program violating the Board\\'s criteria for approval could have its federal matching\\r\\n\\r\\nfunds withdrawn. Federal officials were naturally reluctant to take such a step unless\\r\\nconfronted with severe violations of the spirit of Title IV of the Social Security Act.)\\r\\nA series of Social Security Board rulings in the early 1960s eventually clarified the federal\\r\\npolicy environment for states seeking to reform their ADC programs (Steiner 1966).\\r\\nPrior to this time, however, state reformers demonstrated considerable willingness to\\r\\n\\r\\ntest the policy water - probably because the broadly worded mandates of the Social\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity Act gave them little reason to think changes at the margins of their programs\\r\\nwould create violations. During the second wave, reformers were encouraged by the\\r\\nactions of three successive federal administrations inviting state-level innovation. We\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspect that the different environments operated similarly in providing an open forum\\r\\n\\r\\nfor states to initiate policy changes. Differences may have manifested themselves (if at\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c646 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\nall) in the content of reforms attempted in the states. Any systematic comparison between\\r\\nthe two phases of reform would have to take into consideration the different federal\\r\\nenvironments within which the states operated during the two phases of reform. We do\\r\\n\\r\\nnot seek to produce such a comparison here. Rather, we seek to isolate the factors within\\r\\nand between states driving their decisions about whether and when to submit waivers.\\r\\nFor these purposes, a more circumscribed discussion of the role of the federal\\r\\ngovernment will suffice (see below). We thank an anonymous reviewer at Social Forces\\r\\n\\r\\nfor pointing out the importance of considering longitudinal variation in the federal policy\\r\\nenvironment for researchers interested in explaining the overall story of retrenchment in\\r\\nAFDC, a federalized program of social provision. Although we do not attempt that project\\r\\nhere, we concur that it is essential if we are to fully understand retrenchment processes.\\r\\n3. For reviews of existing theories of welfare state development, see Berry (1994), Skocpol\\r\\nand Amenta (1986), and Soule and Zylan (1997).\\r\\n\\r\\n4.. We should not, however, the widely recognized political vulnerability of the poor,\\r\\nwhich may render this distinction somewhat meaningless.\\r\\n5. This, of course, is similar to arguments made by new institutionalists about mimetic\\r\\n\\r\\nisomorphism. See the many essays in Powell and DiMaggio\\'s (1991) edited volume which\\r\\naddress pressures organizations face toward isomorphism.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.. Bane\\'s article in The American Prospect suggests the extent to which there was general\\r\\nagreement within the Democratically-appointed Department of Health and Human\\r\\n\\r\\nServices about the desirability of extending waivers to the states. This is significant, since\\r\\nprotecting federal authority over public assistance programs had been a hallmark of\\r\\nDemocratic social policy since the Roosevelt Administration.\\r\\n7. It is not surprising that most reform packages that emerged during this reform wave\\r\\n\\r\\n(as well as the earlier wave) were rather similar in content. Paul Burstein and colleagues\\r\\nhave argued that variation in policy ideas and proposals can be very limited (Burstein,\\r\\n\\r\\net al 1995). It is likely that diffusion processes are at least partly responsible for the\\r\\nsimilarity in reform packages found across space and over time.\\r\\n8. The earned income disregard is the amount of money a recipient can earn per month\\r\\nbefore having some or all additional earnings deducted from the amount of the AFDC\\r\\nbenefit check.\\r\\n9. Variations on this model have been used recently by Greve (1995), Davis and Greve\\r\\n\\r\\n(1997), Soule (1995, 1997), Soule (forthcoming), and Soule and Zylan (1997). It has\\r\\nalso been described in Strang and Soule (1998).\\r\\n10. Often, n is referred to as the potential adopter and s as the transmitter.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Note that we do not use the date of adoption, which varied from state to state\\r\\naccording to many (exogenous) factors, including the rapidity with which federal agencies\\r\\nprocessed waiver requests.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. The Hudson Institute cites the following source: U.S. Department of Health and\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman Services, ACF-Section 1115 Waiver Authority, October 1, 1996 Summary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cEnding Welfare As We Know It (Again) / 647\\r\\n13. The address for the APWA is: http://www.apwa.org.\\r\\n14. These are available on the DHHS website: http://www.os.dhhs.gov.\\r\\n15. Traditional regression diagnostics were performed on our data to test for, in\\r\\nparticular, the presence of collinearity among our covariates. Our diagnostics showed\\r\\nthat collinearity was not a problem.\\r\\n16.However, as a proxy for this, we include Wright et al.\\'s (1985) measure of the percentage\\r\\n\\r\\nof liberal voters in the state (results not shown). These authors argue that their measure,\\r\\nwhich is based on survey data, adequately characterizes the ideology of the state.\\r\\n17. FAIR\\'s address is http://www.fairus.org.\\r\\n18. To do this, we ran models with our measures included in both the propensity and\\r\\n\\r\\nthe susceptibility vectors and in each of the vectors separately. We found that most of\\r\\n\\r\\nour measures had effects in the propensity, but not the susceptibility, vector.\\r\\n19. In preliminary analyses, we tested the possibility that there was a simple, linear, inverse\\r\\nrelationship between the level of state-based resources and waiver submission by including\\r\\n\\r\\na measure of state revenues in the propensity vector. When entered along with the other\\r\\n\\r\\nvariables in the model, the coefficient was positive and not significant.\\r\\n20.It is important to note that we are not making the argument that historically innovative\\r\\n\\r\\nstates are, net of other factors, more quick to submit waivers. This would be a propensity\\r\\nvector argument and, in fact, has been made by Soule and Zylan (1997). Here, we are\\r\\n\\r\\ntesting Eyestone\\'s (1977) contention that historical or traditional innovators are more\\r\\nlikely to serve as referents to others; their actions are more likely to be copied than others.\\r\\n21.In addition to Walker\\'s (1969) score, we also tried Savage\\'s (1978) score. The results\\r\\nwere consistent with what is reported below.\\r\\n\\r\\n22. Concerned that California and New York (which receive the lion\\'s share of immigrants\\r\\neach year during our period) were biasing these results, we ran these models excluding\\r\\nthese two states. The coefficient on our measure of immigration remains positive and\\r\\nsignificant even when these two states are excluded.\\r\\n\\r\\n23. It is possible that the effect of unmarried motherhood rates is operating through\\r\\nbenefit levels. Previous research has shown that high benefit states typically have low\\r\\nrates of nonmarital birth (Zylan 1994).\\r\\n\\r\\n24. In these models, we also included the percentage of the AFDC recipient population\\r\\nthat is black (not shown). The coefficient on this measure was positive, but never\\r\\nsignificant.\\r\\n\\r\\n25. It is interesting to note, however, that Soule and Zylan (1997) find the opposite in\\r\\ntheir paper on the earlier wave of retrenchment in AFDC.\\r\\n\\r\\n26. All of the models that include our measure of Unemployment Insurance recipients\\r\\nwere run with the state unemployment rate (not shown). In all cases, the coefficient on\\r\\nthe unemployment rate was not significant and its inclusion did not alter the effect of\\r\\nUnemployment Insurance recipients.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content downloaded from 104.239.165.217 on Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:22:36 UTC\\r\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c648 / Social Forces 79:2, December 2000\\r\\nAPPENDIX\\r\\n\\r\\nVariable and Measurement Notes Source\\r\\n\\r\\nService Sector Receipts Divided by the Service Sector data come from Statistical AbGross State Product (GSP).
